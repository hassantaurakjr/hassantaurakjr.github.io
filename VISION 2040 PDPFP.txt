Framework Plan, 2020-2040.

Executive Summary
1. Background
The Lanao del Sur Provincial Development and Physical Framework Plan (PDPFP) sets out the framework
for the spatial and strategic development of the Province and its component municipalities and city until
2040. The revised document, approved by the Provincial Development Council on [put final date here],
presented to the Sangguiang Panlalawigan on [put final date here], updates the PDPFP that was last
drafted in 2014. As a cross-cutting document, the PDPFP ensures horizontal and vertical linkages with key
government plans, policies, and legislations such as the Philippine Development Plan, the Bangsamoro
Development Plan, local government plans, and their respective spatial frameworks and land use
documents.
While the PDPFP was drafted in accordance with the NEDA Guidelines on Provincial/Local Planning and
Expenditure Management (PLPEM), the Lanao del Sur PDPFP builds on best practices for areas with
specific cultural and peace and security-related requirements relevant to the Bangsamoro, as well as
enhancements for environmental protection and climate change adaptation/disaster risk reduction and
mitigation (CCA/DRRM).
To enhance readability, the PDPFP is divided into three books. Book 1 summarizes the strategic directions
for Lanao del Sur until 2040 based on a spatial framework for development; Book 2: The Planning
Environment covers basic sectoral data comprising the provincial socio-economic profile, which provides
the basis for the strategies discussed in Book 1. Book 3 is the Provincial Investment Plan, 2020- 2040,
containing the long list of priority plans, programs, and activities required to realize the vision articulated
in the PDPFP.

2. Developing a new PDPFP
An analysis of significant spatial trends was carried out as part of the review process, factoring in changes
in population, economic activity, and available physical resources. This is discussed in Chapter 3 on the
brief economic history of the province, Chapter 4 on significant development trends, and Chapter 6 on
the envisioned Spatial Framework. This analysis explained the trends and new challenges along with the
key policy directions.
The main points from the analysis are:
●

The importance of the metropolitan area centered on Marawi City and the adjacent spillover
municipalities such as Saguiaran and Marantao as the driver of economic growth in the
province. The massive displacement of over three hundred thousand people after the 2017
Marawi siege has serious implications on the spatial development of the province, but Marawi
remains the regional and provincial center for administration, commerce, education, health,

and other forms of specialized service delivery—making the completion of Marawi
rehabilitation and reconstruction and equitable provision of dignified housing a major
priority.
The significant role of the agro-industrial corridor on the southwestern side of the province,
especially coastal towns such as Malabang, in generating growth
The importance of key centers and corridors in the eastern side of the province such as the
Basak area and the commercial crops corridors including secondary growth centers in Wao
and Amai Manabilang. These corridors are well-placed to contribute to Lanao del Sur
economic growth, and that critical mass to attract growth and ensure the equitable delivery
of basic services can be reached by supporting clusters of settlements outside Metropolitan
Marawi.
The role of Lake Lanao and its status as a protected area as the anchor and limit of all physical
development in the province, as well as the basis of Mëranaw culture and identity.
The need to invest in sustainable transport, energy, and communications infrastructure that
can support connectivity and the equitable flow of goods and basic services across the
province and surrounding areas.
The importance in all aspects of forward planning to support community peace and security
and address the consequences of climate change and increased disaster vulnerability. The
increasing human and environmental threats mean that there should be a clearer risk
management lens as Lanao del Sur’s residents determine where and how they live and work,
and how the government and the private sector can help citizens mitigate these risks.

The 2017 Marawi crisis and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic exposed the vulnerabilities of local health
and economic systems. While much of the analysis cited in the PDPFP was done prior to the declaration
of a national community quarantine or lockdown regime in March 2020, the adjustments required to
address the effects of the pandemic and the resulting recession must be factored in across all sectors.
While the pandemic also affected the trajectory for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), efforts are
made to link this Plan to this global commitment of all the states.

3. Formulation process and public consultations
Technical preparations and public consultations for PDPFP updating commenced on February 2019 with
the creation of the PDPFP Technical Working Group on October 8, 2018 and a technical writers’ pool in
2019 under the Provincial Land Use Committee. A first set of technical workshops were conducted from
February to April 2019, prior to the midterm elections in May 2020. The PDPFP TWG and Writer’s Pool
were reconvened from August 2019 onwards, supplementing data collection with online and offline
consultations with stakeholders. Activities concluded with a Spatial Framework Workshop in March 2020
that convened twenty-two municipal planning and development officers and municipal engineers. from
the different municipalities in the Province. Local validations were halted by the onset of the COVID-19
pandemic.

4. Vision and aims
The PDPFP takes into account existing conditions, ambitions, and needs of the Province, with the goal of
putting in place economic, social, environmental, infrastructure, and governance-related investments that
will support and enable the aspirations of Lanao del Sur to be met, while factoring in cultural and securityrelated realities. Chapter 3 details the PDPFP vision and aims, as follows:
Table 1. PDPFP Vision
English

Mëranaw

In the name of the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
By the year 2040,

Sa Ingaran o Allah a Masalinggagao, a makalimoon
Sii ko ragon a 2040,

We, the people of the Lake
envision a Lanao del Sur that is
Green and bountiful
Home to a vibrant, progressive, equitable, and
prosperous economy
that preserves our unique culture and ecology

Sukami a mga taw sa Ranaw, na puzingayoan

Based on stakeholder consultations, the PDPFP identifies key principles for provincial development. In
order to achieve a “vibrant, progressive, equitable, and prosperous economy that preserves our unique
culture and ecology”, the residents of Lanao del Sur envision forms of development that are green, ensure
food-security, and translate to. equitable, prosperous, and peaceful gains for all Mëranaws. The role of
the Provincial Government of Lanao del Sur in helping all residents realize this vision is articulated in the
provincial mission statement, as follows:
“We, the provincial government of Lanao del Sur, are committed to build the
enabling environment for a bountiful, prosperous, and peaceful Lanao by setting in
place basic services, systems, and partnerships for development in line with Islamic
values of good governance, stewardship, and community participation.”

5. The Spatial Framework
Chapter 5 describes the proposed Spatial Framework, which is meant to enable strategic choices in
relation to economic, service delivery, governance, and infrastructure development in Lanao del Sur. The
components of the Framework were initially identified by the Provincial economic team and validated
through participatory mapping exercises and consultations with stakeholders, as follows:
a) Metropolitan Marawi Cluster. The Metro Marawi cluster is defined as the continuous builtup area centered on the Islamic City of Marawi, its adjacent municipalities of Marantao and
Saguiaran, as well as the arc stretching across Balindong (Watu), Ditsaan-Ramain, Bubong,
and Buadiposo-Buntong. It is the center of Commerce, Trade, and Education of Lanao del Sur
and is the gateway for subregional transport and trade for most communities around Lake
Lanao. With the destruction of the urban core of Marawi City in 2017, many residents and
their economic and social activities have been partially displaced to the neighboring cities of
Iligan and Cagayan de Oro as well as other towns within Lanao del Sur.
b) Agro-Industrial Zone. This area covers the corridor of municipalities in from the northwest to
the southwest side of Lake Lanao, stretching from Piagapo, Madalum, Bacolod Kalawi
(Bacolod Grande), Madamba, Pualas, to the lakeside municipalities of Ganassi, Binidayan,
Bayang, Lumbatan, Lumabayanague, the landlocked municipalities of Calanogas, Pagayawan
(Tatarikan), Tubaran, Marogong Sultan Dumalondong, and down to the coastal areas of
Picong (Sultan Gumander), Malabang, Balabagan, and Kapatagan, leading to the neighboring
province of Maguindanao. In terms of built-up area and economic activity, Malabang is the
dominant secondary growth area in this zone, bolstered by the presence of plantation crops
and traditional ports leading up to Picong.
c) Basak Rice Granary Zone. These are the traditional rice production areas and wetlands in the
eastern side of Lake Lanao, stretching from the lakeside municipalities of Mulondo, Taraka,
Tamparan, to Poona Bayabao (Gata), Maguing, and Lumba-Bayabao, as well as gradually
higher-elevation areas in Masiu and Butig.
d) Commercial Crops Production Corridor. These areas include Bumbaran (Amai Manabilang)
and Wao on the southeastern side of the province, as well as northeast municipalities of Kapai
and Tagoloan II, which are sites of agricultural plantations with trade links to Bukidnon and
other neighboring areas outside Lanao del Sur.
e) Lake Lanao. Special emphasis is placed on Lake Lanao and the surrounding watershed, which
is of major environmental, economic, and cultural significance not only for Lanao del Sur but
for the BARMM and the Philippines as a whole.

iv

As part of Lanao del Sur’s commitment to development that acknowledges the unique culture and ecology
of the province, the Spatial Framework factors in cultural clusters and significant sites, including precolonial spatial governance arrangements related to traditional leadership and the Pat a Pängampong sa
Ranaw (the four Principalities of Lanao).
The Spatial Framework will provide opportunities for the province to work with neighboring provinces
and municipalities in BARMM and other regions. At present, this covers the four major gateways or entry
points to the province, namely (i) the northern route traversing the Municipality of Saguiaran towards
Iligan City, Lanao del Norte via Iligan- Marawi Road; (ii) the northeastern route covering the Municipalities
of Wao and Amai Manabilang towards Municipality of Kalilangan, Bukidnon via Wao- Kalilangan Road; (iii)
the southern route traversing the Municipality of Kapatagan towards Municipality of Matanog,
Maguindanao via Cotabato- Lanao Road; and (iv) the Southwestern gateway from the Municipality of
Picong towards the Municipality of Sultan Naga Dimaporo, Lanao del Norte via Malabang- Tukuran Road.
The Framework also factors in additional investments in the province as part of the national and regional
efforts for Marawi rehabilitation and reconstruction, as well as those related to the Normalization process
under the 2014 Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro signed between the central government
and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front. National TFBM rehab commitments will cover parts of Metro
Marawi as well as affected communities in Butig. The Normalization process, on the other hand, will affect
areas included in Camp Badr and Camp Bilal as well as other sites identified by the Joint Normalization
Committee.
The map below describes the elements of the Spatial Framework.
The Spatial Framework is informed and in turn will inform the preparation of municipal and city-level Land
Use Plans. In preparation for more rigorous provincial land use computations, the table below shows initial
existing land use percentages per municipality based on digitized satellite imagery on OpenStreetMap
(OSM), broken down as forestland, grassland/agricultural areas, and residential settlements. This route
was chosen given technical issues with 2012 NAMRIA Data and 2002 DENR land cover data, including a
very large offset with coastline observed in the lake area. Further details on the methodology is attached
as Annex 3. Plans for vetting with PLGU/MLGU representatives were prevented by the onset of the
pandemic; these initial outputs will need to be recalibrated in partnership with DENR and the relevant
local governments.

6. Strategies for Development
Based on the existing realities discussed in Book 2, the PDPFP provides strategic guidance on long term
policy directions to inform public, private, and community investments and push Lanao del Sur towards a
modern and forward-looking market economy, by 2040, that is rooted in its core capabilities in agriculture,
trade, and eco-cultural tourism.
Guidance is discussed across seven sectors, covering (i) Environment; (ii) Economy; (iii) Social.
Development (health, education, protective services); (iv) Infrastructure (transport, energy,
communications); (v) culture; (vi) governance, and (vii) peace and security. A working list of PPAs
(including locations, technical specifications, indicative costs) to realize the Province’s vision is spelled out
in Book 3.
Across all sectors, the analysis is grounded on the changing needs of the population, which will reach
1.868 million by 2040, and is expected to double the 2015 level of population by 2045. As Lanao del Sur is
the 4th most populous province in Mindanao in 2015 and is the most mobile, migration will continue to
define the social geography of the province, current state of displacement notwithstanding.
To achieve the province’s vision of peace and prosperity, efforts should be made to address disparities in
living standards and access to services, which manifests itself spatially and exacerbates social tensions.
The PDPFP, if implemented, will lead to a shift from a monocentric (Marawi-based) to a polycentric
(multiple corridor and growth center) spatial regime, where business and employment opportunities can
be supported along the radial and periphery municipalities.
While the PDPFP covers the basic service delivery required to address poverty and vulnerability in the
province, Book 1 puts a focus on ‘gamechanger’ strategies, which aim to achieve significant positive
effects with limited resources. The need for these so-called gamechangers are highlighted by the COVID19 pandemic, where investments that were once considered ambitious pre-2020 are now basic needs in
the so-called new normal. An example is the need for investments in fast internet connection and mobile
communication across the province to aid economic productivity, access global markets, and improve the
living standards of each household.
6.1. Strategies for Environment
Sectoral Goal: Our goal is that by 2040, the people of Lanao del Sur will be responsible stewards to its
environment through creating and implementing fact-based environmental policies, and protecting its
protected areas grounded on Islamic principles and values.

Empowering the Lake Lanao Development Council to
oversee the protection of Lake Lanao or lobby for the
legislation of the Lake Lanao Development Authority
(LLDA), similar to Laguna Lake Development Authority.
Management of land areas outside the LLW but inside
Lanao del Sur Province have no direct effects upon the
environmental state of the LLW. However, to the
extent that such outside areas can serve as alternative
livelihood sites and can divert from the LLW some of
the inappropriate land uses that harm the Watershed,
they should be included in development projects as
part of the strategy.
Establish linkages with foreign or local institutions
advocating on concerns in environmental/watershed
protection and development. And make development
plans and sell them to donor countries or institutions.
Rehabilitate degraded portions of the watersheds
through proper reforestation programs
Improve implementation of environmental laws and
ordinances
Prevent illegal encroachment on protected areas
Implement the total log ban in the province and show
spiritual and moral concern toward protection of the
ecology and environment through dissemination of
Information Education Campaign materials and
conduct of multi-sectoral training.
Regular training and capacity building of
environmental law enforcement agents e.g. park

Opening opportunities for farmers and fishers to
strengthen, diversify and sustain their livelihood.
Promotion of organic agriculture and agri-forestry
in Taraka River, Masiu River, Malabang River among
others.
Propose a long-term partnership project between
PLLDS and MSU on the river and lake water quality
monitoring. Include the whole province and not just
the Lake Lanao watershed. MSU can be tapped since it
has a number of researchers as well as satellite
campuses within the province.

Message from the Governor

Office of the Provincial Governor
MESSAGE
Assalamu'alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh!
The Provincial Development and Physical Framework Plan (PDPFP) 2020-2040 of
the Provincial Government of Lanao del Sur is a landmark planning document
for this administration, one that has been produced after a truly participatory
process. A lot of challenges along the way but these challenges did not hinder
this administration in accomplishing this document. As Chief Executive of the
Province of Lanao del Sur, and as an advocate of good, sustainable, stakeholderdriven and inclusive planning in local governance, I am genuinely confident of
this strategic document that defines the future of Lanao del Sur if taken with
utmost sincerity and full commitment by all sectors. This plan provides the
overall development framework of the province and translates our vision into
practical strategies that can be implemented.
As proud as we are for continuously exemplifying courage, determination and
resiliency in the wake of many calamities and challenges, most notably the 2017
Marawi Siege and the current COVID-19 pandemic, we shall remain unwavering
with our commitment for sustained poverty reduction paired with local
economic development strategies, carefully balanced with sustainable
development and environmental management principles, all summed up in our
sustainable development call, “Forward Lanao del Sur!”.
As we build on our accomplishments, we remain thankful for the cooperation,
collaboration and partnerships from all sectors that were established throughout
the course, most especially the United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP) who has nothing but Lanao del Sur’s sustainable development as their
vision, which further empowered us to craft a PDPFP that we believe in, one that
we feel passionately about.
Given the enthusiasm and commitment of all sectors, I am heartened by the
promise for sustained recovery and reconstruction, as well as the upliftment of
the lives of the people in our communities, as evidenced by the rich potential
unveiled in this PDPFP. Together, let us not leave any stone unturned and make
Lanao del Sur a haven of true development in all aspects.
Wassalam!

Message from the Vice Governor
Assalamualaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh!
Greetings of Peace, Prosperity and Good Health to All.
Alhamdulillah, with our long journey conducting series of meetings,
workshops, planning and community validations we now finally have our
Provincial Development and Physical Framework (PDPFP) for the year 2020 to
2040. PDPFP is a very important document for all of us not just in the Provincial
Government of Lanao Del Sur (PLGU LDS), as it will be our guide in all the
development works that we will hand-in-hand weave together as one Ranaw to
achieve our visions hereunder.
In our PDPFP 2020-2040, we set to propose a spatial framework that would
enable strategic choices in relation to economic, service delivery, governance,
and infrastructure development in Lanao del Sur to where clustering of
City/Municipality were co-designed by Provincial Economic Team and
Stakeholders. By 2040, we envision to have the (1) Metropolitan Marawi Cluster as
the center of Commerce, Trade, Education and is the gateway for subregional
transport and trade for most communities around Lake Lanao, (2) Agro-Industrial
Zone, (3) Basak Rice Granary Zone, (4) Commercial Crops Production Corridor,
and (5) The Lake Lanao. The spatial framework will open a great opportunity for
us to work with our neighboring provinces and as well an investment for the
rehabilitation of Marawi City.
The Ranaw PDPFP 2020-2040, may seem to be so promising and I must say
that it excites me for what we envision our province to look like in the year 2040,
but we must accept the fact that the implementation of our plans will not be
easy. However, I do firmly believe that nothing is impossible if we the people of
Ranaw will work together towards a Lanao del Sur that is Green and bountiful
Home to a vibrant, progressive, equitable, and prosperous economy that
preserves our unique culture and ecology that can sustain safe, empowered, and
self-disciplined communities that are healthy, productive, and live in peace and
camaraderie Supported by good governance, stewardship, and community
participation in line with Islamic principles and values.

Chapter 1: Introduction
1.1. Background

T

his document is the revised Provincial Physical Development and Physical Framework Plan for the
development of Lanao del Sur, as the primary spatial and multi-sectoral plan for the province until
2040. In recognition of the rapidly evolving challenges in the province in the last few years, this
PDPFP amends the previous draft that was published in 2014. While many of the issues and objectives
articulated in the previous plan are still valid, this document now replaces it.
The Province of Lanao del Sur is located in the southern island-region of Mindanao and is one of the five
provinces of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). Its neighbors are Lanao
del Norte to the north, Bukidnon to the east, and Maguindanao to the south. Its capital is the Islamic City
of Marawi, which sits on the shores of Lake Lanao.
Lanao del Sur was legally created as result of Republic Act No. 2228, which divided the unified Lanao
Province into Lanao del Norte and Lanao del Sur on 27 May 1959. Lanao del Sur was officially created
almost two months later on July 4, 1959 with 25 municipalities including Dansalan, now Marawi City as
the capital town. However, the history of the Mëranaw people stretches back much longer, prior to the
creation of the Republic of the Philippines. The word “lanao” is derived from the word “Ranaw” which
means “Lake”. Thus, the term “Mëranaw”,1 the natives of the province, means “People of the Lake”. As
with other Bangsamoro subgroups, the Mëranaw can trace its traditional governance structures even
before the Spaniards arrived in the Philippines, specifically through the decentralized Pat a Pängampong
sa Ranaw or four principalities of Ranaw, which comprises a number of royal houses with specific
territorial jurisdictions within mainland Mindanao.
At present writing, Lanao del Sur is comprised of 39 municipalities and one component city, covering 1,159
barangays. [Refer to Map 1] As of the 2015 PSA census, the province is home to 1,045,429 registered
residents although these figures do not include the sizeable Mëranaw diaspora, which due to prevalent
trading practices, led to extensive settlements across the Philippines and globally. The province is
politically subdivided into two congressional districts both under the administrative supervision of the
Provincial Governor. The 1st District has 17 municipalities and Marawi City, while the 2nd District has 22
municipalities. Official statistics of the Philippine Statistics Authority place the land area of the province
at 15,055.51 sq.km.,2 but the DENR-LMB and the Department of Budget and Management suggest that
Lanao del Sur has a land area of 13,754.24 sq.km.

The popular spelling is Maranao, but it does not capture how the locals pronounce it. The lack of a unified local
orthography allowed some spelling variations to emerge: Maranaw, Meranao, Meranaw, M’ranao, M’ranaw, and
Mëranaw. The latter is based on the national orthography of Komisyon ng Wikang Filipino, but many local
phonemes are still not fully captured.

In the last half century, Lanao del Sur’s development trajectory has been framed by subnational armed
conflict between the Government of the Philippines and a number of non-state armed groups, led by the
Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) and later the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). Peace
negotiations eventually led to the creation of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) and
its institutionalization in the 1987 Philippine Constitution. The signing of the 2014 GPH-MILF
Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro (CAB) led to the creation of the BARMM in 2019, which
creates a parliamentary form of government within the unitary Philippine state. The 2017 Marawi crisis
and subsequent efforts to rebuild the affected communities. underscored the need to update the PDPFP,
factoring the unique cultural, environmental, and security-related dynamics in the province and the
specific needs that arise as a result of these conditions.

1.2. Objectives of the PDPFP
The PDPFP provides an overarching strategic planning framework to facilitate and guide public and private
investment in Lanao del Sur. It does not redefine existing sectoral and thematic plans drafted by the
Province and its component municipalities and city (specifically local Comprehensive Development Plans
and Comprehensive Land Use Plans and related instruments), but complements them with a spatial
perspective.
Thus, the PDPFP is intended to meet the following objectives:
1. Define the vision for the province.
2. Provide the analytical basis for understanding existing conditions and identifying
key development issues, goals, objectives, and targets of the province.
3. Translate the vision into strategies that can be implemented to attain the goals,
objectives, and targets.
4. Identify programs and projects consistent with the strategies and which serve as
inputs to the PDIP, which are discussed in Book 3 of this document.
It takes account of key driving forces such as population growth, migration, and urbanization,
demographic shifts, economic changes, rising transport and connectivity needs, as well as Increasing
vulnerability due to climate change and various environmental and human-induced disasters. The PDPFP
also factors in cultural knowledge-practices unique to Lanao del Sur and looks at the spatial implications
of cleavages that exist in society that create peace and order challenges specific to the Bangsamoro
region. Thus the plan seeks to inform and guide Mëranaw community efforts to create a vibrant,
progressive, equitable, and prosperous Lanao del Sur.

1.3. Context and Horizontal and Vertical Linkages
The PDPFP is a key link in the network of plans covering the national, regional, provincial, and
city/municipal levels. It contributes to the Ambisyon 2040 and the Philippine Development Plan and its
spatial framework, and the region’s 1st Bangsamoro Regional Development Plan.
At the provincial level, the PPAs derived from the PDPFP are the bases for a multi-year investment
program (PDIP--a prioritized list of PPAs with cost estimates) and annual investment program (AIP or the
current year “slice” of the PDIP). In turn, the AIP serves as the basis for budgetary allocations for PPAs. As
the primary planning document of the Province, the PDPFP strives for clear linkages to the city and
municipal plans and investment programs. The resulting PDPFP, therefore, serves as a vertical link
between local development objectives and regional and national priorities, including specialized plans
related to Marawi reconstruction, the Bangsamoro transition, and various initiatives funded by national
and foreign donor sources.

1.4. Legal Basis for Planning and Process Undertaken
The PDPFP was drafted in accordance with the NEDA Guidelines on Provincial/Local Planning and
Expenditure Management (PLPEM), with specific adjustments to enhance readability and align the
analysis to the realities on the ground. [Refer to Figure 1] This includes best practices for conflict-affected
areas such as the Conflict Sensitive and Peace Promoting planning guidelines released by Office of the
Presidential Adviser’s on the Peace Process and United Nation Development Programme, and guidebooks
established by the now-defunct Canadian-supported Local Governance Support Program in ARMM.
A detailed description of the process undertaken is attached as Annex 3, including the various policy
issuances passed by the PLGU to facilitate the creation of the PDPFP, including the activation of a Technical
Working Group and a Writer’s Pool under the Provincial Land Use Committee.

1.5. Approach and Coverage of the Plan
1.5.1. Geographical Coverage
The political boundaries of the province define the primary level of geographical analysis. Other provinces
of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) and the country are also included
to provide benchmarks in analyses. City and municipality data will be the focus of analysis although
barangay-level data may be used, wherever applicable.

It must be noted that there is a long-standing history of land contestation in the region. In contemporary
times, this translates to a sizable number of overlapping claims between municipalities and barangays,
and specific cases such as the military reservation in Marawi City and the broader environmental
governance issues between the BARMM and Central Government around the Lake Lanao watershed.
Given these issues, official PSA-NAMRIA boundaries are used for the PDPFP but must be updated pending
the official release of the regional cadastral survey which has yet to be released by DENR-National despite
being completed in the Aquino administration.
Where it makes sense, this Plan also reckons with the state commitments to the Sustainable Development
Goals (SDG). To the extent that the Provincial Government was able to pivot its strategic directions to
deal with the impacts of COVID-19, that is also reflected in this Plan. COVID-19 refers to the disease caused
by the new coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2, discovered in Wuhan, People’s Republic of China in 2019 and
spread quickly around the world (World Health Organization, 2020).

1.5.2. Approach and Temporal Coverage
The unique conditions present in LDS and the Bangsamoro region necessitated a number of innovations
to the standard PDPFP guidelines set in the PLPEM guidelines.
The planning horizon established by the PDPFP is 20 years, guided by a long-term vision. Although
standard PDPFPs are six-year medium-term development plans that are intended to coincide with political
terms of a provincial governor and the national leadership, the leadership of Lanao del Sur decided to
expand the planning analyses beyond the medium-term to consider longer-term trends.
Many of the structural challenges faced by the province will not be solved in six years and must transcend
political timelines. This is a result of conflict and context-specific complexities, including but not limited
to the devastation of Marawi city, which is the provincial economic heart and meeting place of all
communities around Lake Lanao. Estimates show that it will take at least one generation of sustained
development for the BARMM to reach the present development of the rest of the country, a goal that is
further complicated by the COVID-19 pandemic. These are necessary inputs to the identification of
strategies and PPAs for the six-year plan period.

1.5.3. Sectoral Coverage
The planning environment of the PDPFP includes all major sectors relevant to the development of the
province of Lanao del Sur. As much as possible, and in order to establish comparability and context,
sectoral data is linked with national, regional, city, and municipal data.
Apart from the five core elements required by the PLPEM guidelines (Population, Economic Activity,
Physical Resources, Income/Access to Services, and Land Use), additional elements that are fundamental
to development in Lanao del Sur are included. These are Governance, Peace and Security, and Culture.
Disaster Risk reduction and Management is included as a subcomponent of the physical resources and

6

land use sectors, and necessarily informs all other sectors. Specific discussions on transport, energy, and
communications are included in the Infrastructure section. [Refer to Table 2]

1.6. Outline of the Plan
To reflect these conditions and ensure maximum value of the Plan, the PDPFP is presented and organized
in three books, as follows:
Book 1: Strategic Directions for Lanao del Sur, summarizes the vision and mission of the province and how
these will be translated across sectors. Basic information on development issues and the goals, objectives,
strategies, and PPAs are discussed per sector but also looks at how these sectors relate to one another.
The discussion is anchored on the spatial framework of the PDPFP, which takes into account the spatial
characteristics of the province and provides a guide on how all development initiatives will be integrated
across space and place. The spatial framework is intended to help optimize the use and utilization of
natural and physical resources, protect and maintain the integrity of the environment, while supporting
social cohesion.
Although in standard PDPFPs, Book 2 is integrated into the main body of the plan, the technical working
group decided to enhance document readability for decision-making by focusing on the planning
implications given current trends and scenarios, and providing Book 2 as supplemental information/basis
for analysis.
Book 2: The Planning Environment contains updated information on the province covering the basic
sectors required by the PDPFP (population, economic activity, physical resources and transport, income
and service, land use and physical framework), with additional discussion on disaster risk reduction,
culture, and peace and security.

Book 3: Provincial Investment Plan, 2020- 2040. This provides an initial list of priority and ‘gamechanger’
PPAs for the period. Given limited time and resources to address the immense developmental gaps being
faced by the province, this is intended to help guide the location and direction of public and private
investment.

Chapter 1 presents the background, objectives, historical coverage, geographical coverage and
the sectoral area.
Chapter 2 Brief Economic History of the Province, Ranaw, and the Mëranaw people, from the
1980s to the present.
Chapter 3 discusses the vision of the Province of Lanao del Sur, reflective of the development
aspirations of its political leaders and stakeholders, which is in accord to the perceived role of
the province at the regional level and national level in general.
Chapter 4 summarizes six key trends in the planning environment that serves as bases for the
identification of development issues/problems, overall goals and objectives, strategies,
programs and activities
Chapter 5 is the overall physical framework which discusses the spatial development direction of
the province in the next twenty years including the roles and functions of its component
municipalities.
Chapter 6 logically enumerates the sectoral strategies as well as the spatial strategies, plans,
programs and activities that need to be undertaken to address the development issues and
problems to attain the plan’s overall objectives.
Chapter 7 deals with the plan implementation, which embraces the review, approval and
adoption process, plan phasing and integration, as well as monitoring and evaluation.

Chapter 2. Brief Economic History of the Province, Ranaw and the
Mëranaw People

T

he province of Lanao del Sur was created by virtue of Republic Act (RA) No. 2228 on May 27, 1959,
dividing the unified Lanao Province, also called Ranaw by the locals, into two provinces: Lanao del
Norte and Lanao del Sur. Lanao del Sur was officially created on July 4, 1959 with 25 municipalities
including Dansalan, now the Islamic City of Marawi as the capital town.

2.1. Lanao del Sur in the 1980s: A Community of Social Weavers
Lanao del Sur had a population of 405 thousand at the start of the 1980s. The province was in the throes
of Moro struggle involving the Moro National Liberation Front and was often punctuated by violent
conflict amidst the martial raw regime. Clan governance pervaded much of the social landscape of the
province which was inherited from the long socio-political traditions of Pat a Pängampong sa Ranaw (the
four principalities of Ranaw). What could have been a dramatic change in the geo-political scene to divide
Lanao de Sur into two provinces, Province of Maranaw and Province of Lanao del Sur,3 did not prosper
because of the martial law and for good reasons. A divided Lanao del Sur would place an administrative
and political barrier to economic and spatial integration.
The secessionist movement that some interpret to be a struggle over two opposing social identities (Islam
versus Christian, Mëranaw and otherness or saruwang a taw) motivated the renaming of the province’s
capital into the Islamic City of Marawi in 1980. However, this did not deter urban areas in the province to
be cultural hubs of Mëranaws living alongside other non-Moro ethnic groups and the Chinese merchants.
The relative ease of entry of goods from Malaysia and Indonesia through the barter trading system
reinforced the position of Marawi as the center of trade and commerce in the province, Tamparan as
satellite trading center, and Malabang as transshipment hub of goods. Cyclical and temporary migration
dramatically rose. The entrepreneurial spirit in major areas paved way for a shared sense of community
in the province, particularly in urban areas. Markets served as a primary civic center so that trading and
face-to-face contact facilitated a great deal of social interaction.
Marawi continued to attract non-Mëranaw families who sent their children to study at the Mindanao
State University (MSU) and in a few private colleges. Gaining its reputation for tolerance and pluralism,
Lanao del Sur was becoming a tourist destination for its national parks, golf course, and cultural sites. In
contrast, the municipality of Wao, some 114 kilometers to Marawi via Cagayan de Oro, was still reeling
from the fresh social tension brought by the Philippine homestead program and state-sponsored killings

of the Ilaga movement that lasted in the mid-1970s. The sympathy of Middle Eastern and North African
countries towards the Moro struggle opened more doors for Mëranaws to sojourn as students and
exchange scholars abroad in the early 1980s.
Lanao del Sur saw the beginning of a construction boom of major community infrastructure: the Filipino
Libyan Friendship Hospital, madaris, masajid and other structures with Islamic significance. Excess
petrodollar funds in the Middle East earned from a series of oil price hikes of the OPEC economies in the
1970s and early 1980s funded various community infrastructures in the province. The pan-Islamic
movement that had spread to South and Central Asia attracted a younger and intellectual Mëranaw
population to advance their studies in these countries by the end of the decade.
In 1989, Lanao del Sur joined the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM). But Marawi became
an administrative enclave when it opted to be not part of the ARMM.

2.2. Lanao del Sur in the 1990s: Rapid Urbanism, Migration, and Religious Movements
The expansion of the trade sector in Lanao del Sur gave way to localization of economies in few urban
districts and deep specialization in wholesale and retail trade and commerce. Craftsmen and traders
required the services of financiers, logisticians, laborers, administrators, drafters, restaurant management
workers, and tour guides. In the process, it diversified the service sector of the local economy. Migration,
trade, and urbanization in Marawi and Malabang ensued paving way for the emergence of the middle
class with high earnings capacity. Rural areas benefited as they continued supplying agricultural
commodities to the burgeoning urban population. Because the need to consolidate harvests to be
transported to urban areas rose, farm consolidators and transport operators found opportunities to
operate in areas where volume and economies of scale expanded. Hence, Tamparan, Balindong (Watu),
and Pualas-Ganassi positioned themselves as transit municipalities.
The expansion of the construction sector in the Middle East ushered in spells of international outmigration of Mëranaw professionals and technicians in the 1990s. Marawi served as the transit area of
residents coming from rural areas in Lanao del Sur to the Middle East. High wages abroad created a longterm dilemma for the province as it drained the workforce both in the agriculture (whose employ easily
shifted towards lucrative courses) and technical services.
The rooted family or clan structure of the Mëranaws encouraged emigrant workers to repatriate their
earnings back home. Still convinced by the opportunity presented by the agglomeration of economies,
families of emigrant workers considered—and continues to do so—Marawi (and nearby cities outside the
province) as the first choice of investments even for those who had hailed originally from other
municipalities in Lanao del Sur. As a result, property prices shot up in Marawi. City size (measured by
population density) expanded. Settlements continued to swell up in towns adjacent to the capital, namely
Marantao, Saguiaran, Bubong, and Balindong (Watu).

10

Meanwhile, returning Mëranaw students from Middle East, North Africa, and Central and South Asia
brought with them foreign ideals, thoughts, and traditions. These students became the new breed of
religious scholars of the province. Towards the end of the decade, imported movements such as the
Jema’at Al-Tabligh from Pakistan (but originally from India4), swept the social landscape and local political
structures. Two political parties, Ompia and Ummah, formed by foreign-trained ulama (religious scholars),
dominated the local leadership in successive terms towards the latter part of the 1990s until 2007. The
youth wing of Ummah, Markhazosshabab al-Muslim fil Filibbin (Center for Muslim Youth of the
Philippines), or locally known as Shabab and sponsored by Kuwaiti funds, established its traction in the
communities when it started building and managing schools, clinics, and community centers.
Stricter interpretations of Islamic thoughts replaced the pervading tolerant Islamic practices and
indigenous beliefs. Community festivities in public spaces, such as the nightly Banggolo affair during the
month of Ramadhan or the kalilang (indigenous food, music, and dance festivity) held regularly in Plaza
Cabili, were seen to pierce the veil of shirk (or idolatry). Anything that disagreed with public morals of the
time was forbidden by the religious leaders. Social policies that strictly defined roles and dictated
attitudes and morals based on gender including requiring women to dress in black abaya (Arabic fulllength outer garment) were passed. Women donning face makeup or not wearing a proper head gear in
public spaces were castigated.
Lanao del Sur was witnessing an evolving social geography shaped by the changing dynamics towards an
exclusivist Islamic revivalism enveloping some parts of the Middle East, North Africa, South Asia, Central
Asia, and few countries in Southeast Asia. Consequently, the multi-cultural vibe in Marawi, Malabang, and
Tamparan dissipated towards the mid-1990s. Non-Mëranaw traders and shop owners withdrew
themselves from the province. Few Christian minorities retreated to the university district in MSU in
Marawi while the rest moved altogether to Iligan City in Lanao del Norte.
Rapid urbanization and densification of rural areas across Lanao del Sur commanded a new strategic
thinking on infrastructure needs to support the evolving economic and geographic structures. Located in
the heart of Marawi, the Agus I Hydroelectric Power Plant, a national project, which began its construction
in 1979 was completed in early 1990s commercially serving the rest of Mindanao. Agus I is the most
upstream structure and is connected to the network of hydroelectric power plants in Saguiaran and Lanao
del Norte. It was initially seen by residents as the cornerstone of infrastructure development to steer
Lanao del Sur into the modern era of economic resurgence.
With power supply in place, the province identified the coastal municipality of Picong suitable for the
construction of international seaport and the development of agri-industrial zone in neighboring
municipalities. At the same time, in 1992, the Philippines proclaimed the protection of Lake Lanao

watershed5 with a total area of 153 thousand hectares. However, many municipalities in Lanao del Sur
were barely served with electricity. Benefit-sharing arrangements were questioned. As a result, resource
use over Lake Lanao became the main source of collective resentment of residents in the coming decades
amidst the secessionist movement—this time led by the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).

2.3. Lanao del Sur in the 2000s: A Polarized World
Lanao del Sur’s population doubled its 1980 level at the turn of the millennium. The world order was
changing.
The millennium welcomed the Moros with an “all-out war” campaign instigated by the national
government that captured Camp Bushra of the MILF in Butig after the military had assaulted Camp
Abubakar in the neighboring province of Maguindanao. Barely a month after Marawi had voted to join
the ARMM during the 2001 plebiscite, the 9/11 attack happened. It was a global event that polarized
“Islam and the West” identities which reverberated into Lanao del Sur.
Cable television was becoming popular in the province. Internet access was beginning to be introduced in
urban and peri-urban areas, and the technology-savvy youth were learning to appreciate its utility. The
use of mobile communication was steadily increasing. The world was getting connected and the mediums
were exposing the Mëranaws to the unfolding world and domestic events. Urbanization allowed fast
transfer of ideas and exchange of experiences.
At the same time, the rate and scale of urbanization in the province were growing faster while the
resources and management capacities were not able to control the urban challenges nor mitigate the
rising inequality in the living standards. Congestion, poor working conditions, housing gaps, land issues,
pollution, unmitigated crimes, and intolerance are few of the emerging 21st century urban challenges in
Lanao del Sur requiring ingenuous infrastructure solutions and decisive social policies. Investments had
not scaled up to improve household incomes—a necessary condition to adequately address slum
population.
Economic growth was uneven as expected of any economies at the initial phase of development, but
overall development could still be balanced. The province poised itself to pursue spatial integration
marked by the construction of the GMA Integrated Transportation and Food Terminal in Marawi in a bid
to establish a network of municipalities along the agriculture supply chain. But much had to be done to

have the transport hub running. The business environment had to be reassessed to allow the participation
of the private sector in integrated transport and logistics. The Tomawis interprovincial bus system that
plied Marawi to Iligan and Cagayan de Oro exited the market only to be replaced by the highly unregulated
and unregistered private operated car and Asian utility vehicles. The opening of the Laguindingan
International Airport in the neighboring province of Misamis Oriental created an opportunity for mobility
development.
Public markets in various municipalities of Lanao del Sur were constructed. The municipalities of
Bumbaran and Wao were seen at the center of significant economic leap as suppliers of primary
commodities such as abaca and bananas. Their proximity to major players in agriculture processing in
Bukidnon and Cagayan de Oro provided Wao and Bumbaran the natural advantage to break into the large
domestic markets. Ease of mobility would have aided the tourism sector and promoted cultural living
heritage. The town of Tugaya was conferred the recognition as UNESCO Home for Culture and Heritage in
2006 and subsequently the whole province as candidate for UNESCO List of Intangible Cultural Heritage
of Humanity in 2014.
However, the expansion of infrastructure and productive sectors including tourism would be mired by the
looming power crisis. Lanao del Sur Electric Cooperative (LASURECO), the sole electricity distributor in the
province, was tethered to collapse by end of the decade because of mismanagement. Initial talks on debt
moratorium or debt refinancing would only allow LASURECO to acquire a veneer to mask the economic
inefficiencies inherent in a non-contestable market or natural monopoly industry regime. Electricity, after
land, has been a critical concern for businesses and households in the province. Only two power
substations served the entire province resulting in recurrent power interruptions or low electricity
voltage. This is the paradox of Lanao del Sur energy sector: the province has abundant low-carbon and
low-cost energy resources, i.e. hydro and wind (for inland communities) and solar (for coastal areas), but
insufficient capacity.
The decade drew to a close by the eruption of war in 2009 in Central and Western Mindanao a few months
after the collapse of the Memorandum of Agreement on Ancestral Domain, that sought to expand the
autonomous region. While no violent skirmishes broke out in Lanao del Sur, the event did not insulate
residents in few areas like Butig from further alienation.

2.4. Lanao del Sur in the 2010s: A New Frontier
Lanao del Sur’s population breached the one million mark in 2015. The scale and rate of urbanization,
which had strained the local government to cope, inexorably led to overcrowding and the emergence of
urban sprawls in Lanao del Sur. Some areas lived the rising nexus of unmanaged urbanization, migration,
rising inequality in the standard of living, fast diffusion of imported ideologies, proliferation of firearms
trade, and collective frustrations at the pace of the peace process.

The year was 2014 when the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro was signed. But, up until
2018, it invited some sectors in the Philippines polity to resist the signing of the Bangsamoro Organic Law
that resulted in alienating some members of the disaffected segment of the population at risk of armed
group recruitment. Butig, Maguing, and Piagapo were tagged by the security sector hubs of either violence
or illicit activities. Rido was rife across the province. Urban crime rates were rising until recently.
The defining event of the decade was the obliteration of the urban core of Marawi in 2017 in a fierce
battle, that lasted five months, involving the combined forces of the followers of Daula Islamiyya,
fashioned after the ISIS/ISIL and led by the Maute brothers, and the Abu Sayyaf Group against the
Philippine military. This was preceded few years by successive assault in Butig, Piagapo, Masiu, and other
towns.
This attack in Marawi was the turning point, changing the economic and social frontiers of the whole
province. The agglomerating economy of Dansalan and adjacent barangays that were once shaped by
commerce and history vanished in an instant, dispersing economic activities to nearby municipalities and
outside the province. Locating in densely packed areas conferred tremendous economic advantages. The
city center used to account for at least 75 percent of the province’s volume of trade. Dispersing economic
activities, because of the war, certainly reduced economies of scale.
Barely seven months after the battle in Marawi, Typhoon Vinta swept few municipalities in Lanao del Sur
which was historically sheltered from the typhoon belt. The Vinta episode exposed Lanao del Sur to the
realities of changed climate systems. As a result, a twin catastrophe pushed some of the internally
displaced households to severe poverty. If the human and natural disaster trends rage on, forced
migration will certainly continue to define the future demographic and social mobility of the province.
The Marawi battle and the Vinta episode prompted the affected communities to move to informal
settlements along the major routes particularly in Saguiaran, Bubong, Ditsaan-Ramain, Marantao, and
Balindong (Watu). Others outside the province. As a result, this reinforced the linear structural pattern of
settlements, that prevails in many municipalities in Lanao del Sur and which is persistently driven by
accessibility and physical and environmental constraints posed by Lake Lanao basin and ridges.
It will take long for Marawi to reclaim its former glory as a vibrant economic hub of the province. The
failure of national led rehabilitation efforts is a harbinger of a local led initiative on reconstruction and
recovery. A besieged Marawi provides the province and the community the opportunity to build better
on their own collective terms and at their own pace.
The radial enlargement of economic activities outside the city center exhibits economic spillover in action,
which paves a favorable condition to pursue, in the future, an effective spatial integration of Marawi and
adjoining towns into a metropolitan area. To be effective, this will involve infrastructure and institutional
linkages between Marawi and nearby municipalities and between the future metropolitan area with other
peri-urban and far-flung rural towns to allow settlements and to achieve their positions in a functional
and closely integrated urban hierarchy.

14

Foremost of the connective infrastructure in the province, as initial step to achieve its aim of spatial
integration, are the soon to be completed road connecting Lanao del Sur to major roads to Davao via
Mulondo, Maguing, Wao, and another road from Marawi, Kapai, and Tagoloan connected to Talakag in
Bukidnon and Iligan City in Lanao del Norte. The former will significantly reduce travel time from Lanao
del Sur to Davao to five hours from seven hours, and the latter from Lanao del Sur to Cagayan de Oro to
1.5 hours from three hours. A proposed ring road spanning Marawi, Saguiaran, Piagapo, Marantao will
ease up the traffic flow of goods and people. The national government initiated the construction of a road
network to penetrate Butig, an MILF bulwark, extended to two municipalities in Maguindanao, Barira and
Parang, from Bayang, Lumbayanague, and Lumbatan in Lanao del Sur.

2.5. Lanao del Sur in 2020: An Interconnected and Fragile Order
The decade welcomed the global community with a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic that has
wreaked havoc to the economy and community life. Lanao del Sur was not spared. One of its residents
engaged in trade in Metro Manila had contracted the virus and only spread it to unsuspecting many by
the time he returned to the province in early 2020. As of November 29, 2020, a total of 1,077 confirmed
positive cases were reported in Lanao del Sur and 44 persons succumbed. The virus only highlights five
things.
One, climate change is real and any perturbation to the natural balance of the environment will surely
strike back at the people. Second, increased mobility and trade come with the risk of exposure of the
Mëranaws to all kinds of diseases and harm. Third, addressing the pandemic, or any future pandemic, and
consequently economic recovery, requires the entire machinery of the government and the cooperation
of the community members. Fourth, the pandemic exposes the fragility of the health, social, and economic
foundations of the province. This calls for serious effort to invest in sustainable health systems,
infrastructures, social protection, and urban management to reduce any adverse impacts of future
outbreaks or economic shocks. And, fifth, the return of Mëranaw overseas workers and domestic traders
to the province has put an unbearable strain on the ability of the local economy and existing urban and
rural amenities to accommodate the sudden surge of inward migration.
This decade requires the province to do all its might and wit to jumpstart its economy, to sustain it well
above the other neighbors, and to prepare itself to any future shock. It needs provide the essential
physical, economic, and social infrastructures and services to meet the pressures of expanding population
and migration.

2.6. Lanao del Sur Tomorrow: Balanced and Shared Progress for Posterity
The population of Lanao del Sur is expected to reach 1.877 million by 2040, or almost double its 2015 level
(or almost quintuple its 1980 level). At this rate, at least 33 percent of the population will be packed in
just eight percent of total land area of the province, comprising the six adjoining areas of: Bubong, DitsaanRamain, Marantao, Marawi, Saguiaran, and Balindong (Watu)—the proposed metropolitan area. Rural to
urban net migration will stretch the population in these areas in the decades to come. Lanao del Sur, by
Vision 2040

then, will have a population density of five persons per hectare from 2.8 in 2015. In contrast, the proposed
metropolis will have an 18.2 population density in 2040 compared to 10.2 in 2015. The coastal towns of
Balabagan, Kapatagan, Malabang, and Picong, to the south-west of the province, currently have a
combined population of 10 percent of the province’s total.
Once developed into a port area and agri-industrial community, the coastal towns will considerably attract
people from nearby municipalities of Lanao del Sur and Maguindanao and will hasten the traffic flow of
goods and people in and out of the province. The land-locked agricultural communities of Wao and
Bumbaran (Amai Manabilang) to the south-east and Kapai and Tagoloan to the north-east will see
increased settlements and economic activities now that improved routes connect them to Cagayan de
Oro City, one of the major expanding agglomerated economies of Mindanao, and to Davao.
Lanao del Sur will not experience an age-driven demographic shift given the population growth trends.
Young population will still favor Lanao del Sur. However, the combined young and old dependency rate
will hover at 75 to 80 percent of the working age population. This pattern highlights the crucial role of
social infrastructure and child- and age-friendly physical infrastructure as well as the social policies that
will govern the dependents to prepare them in their future roles in the productive sector.
External conditions and the governing social dynamics in the recent past few decades significantly
changed the landscape of urban and peri-urban areas in Lanao del Sur, except Wao, to an ethnically
homogenous population. The future challenge is to open the province and invite people from different
backgrounds to productively engage and learn from each other towards a shared future for progress.
Diversity enhances technical progress and economic growth spillover.
Further, sustained economic growth and development will only be realized once the ecological assets are
protected to confer continuous streams of benefits for all.
The future driver of local economic growth of Lanao del Sur is the transformation from primary agriculture
to industry and services—favoring a type of industrialization that is rooted in value creation of the
agriculture sector as opposed to heavy industries.
The proposed metropolitan area will be the center of employment, trade, and commerce. The service
sector, that includes banking and finance, logistics and transportation, and administration, will gravitate
towards the metropolitan area to support the modern sector. Because of their natural and physical
advantages (e.g. natural harbor), coastal towns will accommodate light to medium industries of
agricultural processing for products destined to domestic and international markets. These communities
will experience profound changes as the location of the transit economy of value-laden goods and people.
The rest of Lanao del Sur will be clustered as suppliers of complementary agricultural products destined
to the coastal towns for processing into high value commodities.
The ultimate objective is to create an ecosystem of integrated municipalities along the supply value chain.
The strategy is to create an environment to allow economic breakthrough in one or two industries. Once
16

the industry breaks into the domestic and global markets, it can lead to spillover to other industries and
sectors. Premium is given to agricultural products uniquely identifiable as Lanao del Sur’s very own,
subject to the dictates of the market. Tourism and culture will play a vital role to showcase the collective
identity of the province and the uniqueness, not differences, of each municipality. Infrastructure,
institutions, social services, peace and security, physicality, and targeted interventions will buttress the
prospects of spatially and economically integrated province. This economic and spatial arrangement will
support the population base both in urban and rural areas and will encourage accelerated rate of
economic convergence or catch-up.
Lanao del Sur has many physical and development challenges. Its constraints must be viewed as
investment opportunities, as a way forward, to gradually see more innovations towards prosperity. The
province will need to start a new generation of investment opportunities that will influence its ability to
leapfrog into the future. The transformational solution for Lanao del Sur to unlock its potential for high,
inclusive, and environmentally balanced growth lies on “out-of-the-box” thinking and innovations to
overcome the pressures of old and modern-day challenges. Ultimately, the future policy directions of the
province must hinge on the wisdom that the speed and smoothness of transition of the province from low
income to middle or upper-middle income status depend crucially on the spatial organization of economic
and social activities.

Chapter 3: Vision, Mission, and Development Principles
3.1. Principles for Development
3.1.1. Green Province

P

eople choose to live in Lanao del Sur because of its cool climate, lush greenery, abundant fauna,
and clear bodies of water. Unabated human and economic activities with large adverse
externalities must be tackled to preserve Lanao del Sur’s “aggregate natural capital”6—the lungs
of the province. Lanao del Sur government is committed to internalizing the ecological basis of the
Mëranaw society to promote the desirable trajectory of its human welfare, enhance future economic
growth, and reduce the occurrence of conflicts that may arise from competition of resources primarily
land. “Green growth” provides solid conditions for both urban and economic growth in the province. A
green province is where children can live well and where the future generations feel safe, enabled to be
productive members of the society.
Promoting green growth requires systems and structural change. Innovation will be central to the pursuit
of green growth. Policies must complement infrastructure and processes. The governance framework for
green growth must secure collective actions across all backgrounds to secure stronger environmental
leverage.
This policy is consistent with SDGs 6 (sustainable access to water), 8 ( inclusive and sustainable growth) 9
(resilient and sustainable industrialization), 11 (inclusive and sustainable human settlements), 13 (combat
climate change), 14 (sustainable use of marine resources) and SDG 15 (sustainable use of terrestrial
ecosystems).

3.1.2. Food Secure Province
Food is the foundation of individual productivity and wellbeing. An empty belly spooks one’s ability to
work. Food and proper nutrition are linked to well-being, ecological health productivity and economic
growth. Food also plays a central role in local traditions and culture from food cultivation to preparation,
and utilization. It fosters long-term stability of community relations. A Mëranaw community invokes the
traditional rite of sëmang to welcome any family with newly built house with food, to mark community
acceptance or belongingness, and to signal progressive community settlement. Kandädäwagä is a food
sharing culture because it not only conveys a deep sense of altruism but also forges camaraderie and good
neighborhood. While kanduri is a celebration of important life events of families and clans, it places a
particular importance on food in sealing the resolution of conflict involving warring clans in a rido, that

6

Bowen and Hepburn (2014).

18

were initially caught in a spiral wave of spite and spate of retaliation. Food in these instances is central to
urban forms and functions.
Food security shall be the core of local governance in Lanao del Sur. Sustainable food systems in Lanao
del Sur shall favor local food production and utilization with low environmental footprint. As the province
leaps into agriculture-based modernization, food will be an important driver in restructuring the economy,
tourism, employment, local finance and taxation, transport, education, health, peace and order, disaster
management, and community. It shall place high premium on locally produced goods by the communities
and with high nutritional value content and away from highly altered food commercially available. Food
is traditionally viewed within the purview of rural development but urbanization is a reality in the province
that must be seriously considered in this plan. The rate of urbanization in Lanao del Sur highlights looking
into: 1) urban forms of food systems, plot-by-plot, 2) new ways to tackle food waste, and 3) optimization
of use of the land resource and existing structures within highly settled areas for an enduring success of
food security. Food security is both a rural and urban concern.
This principle is directly linked to SDG 2 (ending hunger, food security and sustainable agriculture).

3.1.3. Equitable Province
Lanao del Sur wants to be a province of possibilities that are available to all. It will pursue policies that
guarantee equitable) opportunities which is a key condition for urban and rural economic growth and
development to converge over the long-time horizon. Lanao del Sur will evolve as a province that supports
spatially blind institutions as the cornerstone of equal opportunity. The latter does not imply that
economic activities will be dispersed out at the expense of agglomeration of economies or localization of
industries. Rather, the means to partake in economic opportunities must be available to all. Included in
the institutions is the provision of basic services in settlements in all corners of the province. Institutions
and basic services are the safeguards to urban-rural economic growth disparities that naturally
accompany agglomeration of economies at the initial phase of development. Stable and responsive
institutions will empower residents to create or access opportunities wherever the latter emerge or
whichever forms they take. A growing local economy beckons healthy, educated, and empowered
individuals. In the same way, an empowered pool of workforce and their families are what makes an
economy progressive and a community inclusive. Equal opportunity prevents residents from being
alienated from economic and community affairs. It is the foundation of peace promotion.
Lanao del Sur is committed to the long-standing Islamic teaching of stewardship (khalifa) and the
indigenous tradition of care for the future generation (or moriyataw). Intergenerational equity is the
bedrock of balanced and progressive economic development. The province fully embraces the wisdom
that ensuring the welfare and quality of life of the present generation must not compromise the wellbeing
of the future generation.

3.1.4. Prosperous and Progressive Province
Lanao del Sur will swing its long-term economic trajectory towards rapid growth and prosperity with
environmental care. High per capita income is a necessary condition that the province must pursue for
poverty alleviation and all development efforts objectives to succeed. The province views economic
prosperity and progress only in terms of producing more economic outputs that will showcase and stamp
the identity of Mëranaws however they are embedded in the final products or services, whether the
process of producing them, or the environment by which they are organized to produce the goods and
services. This means that economic progress in Lanao del Sur is a summative articulation of value creation
as opposed to the standard economic pursuit of value addition, without prejudice to meeting the global
standards or balancing the capacity of the ecology or the needs of the future generation. The province
departs from how economic progress is traditionally treated with a mechanistic end goal of producing
more material goods and accumulating more wealth. It is about utilizing the economy to achieve individual
and collective comfort, pride, dignity, safety, security, and social cohesion—both present and future
generations.
This policy is consistent with SDGs 1 (ending poverty in all forms), 2 (ending hunger, food security and
sustainable agriculture) 8( inclusive and sustainable growth) 9 (resilient and sustainable industrialization),
10 (reduce inequality), 11 (inclusive and sustainable human settlements), 12 (sustainable production and
consumption), 13 (combat climate change), 14 (sustainable use of marine resources) and SDG 15
(sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems).

3.1.5. Peaceful Province
Lanao del Sur is committed to positive peace, an environment by which human potential of both
Mëranaws and non-Mëranaws can flourish harmoniously. Creating the space, attitudes, conditions,
institutions, and prospects for the Mëranaws are essential to allow residents to exercise their human
agency for a safe and just society. Peace is a public good and any deviance requires collective solutions.
The sources of grievances that can potentially plunge the province or any of its communities to violence
must be addressed. Conflict and violence are development in reverse, and they are costly. The roles of
self-organization, civic engagement, and cooperation are important to complement existing structures on
dispute settlement. The province is aware of the mutual and self-reinforcing relationship between peace
and economic progress. Peace is a necessary condition for commerce and industry, sustained growth, and
economic affluence. A broadly shared prosperity and economic stability, in turn, foster peace. A weak
economy and mismanaged use of land makes a community prone to conflict.
This principle is aligned with SDG 16 (peaceful and inclusive societies).

Chapter 4: Where we are: Six Significant Trends
4.1. Rapid Rise in Population

P

anao del Sur’s population will reach 1.877 million by 2040. [Refer to Figure 2] In another five years,
the population will double its 2015 level. A large population can be either boon or bane to the
province depending on how the local government is able to transform its population base into a
productive workforce to support its local economy and reduce poverty. The province will invest in
extensive human capital formation to sustain a successive generations of responsible, disciplined,
productive, and peace-loving residents.

4.2. Increasing Movements of People
Migration will continue to define the social geography of the province. Lanao del Sur is the 4th most
populous province in Mindanao in 2015 and is the most mobile. Locals put up great pains of being apart
from their families and communities because they explore income-earning opportunities concentrated
in few areas in the Philippines and abroad. Within the province, local residents flock to urban and periurban areas for trade, commerce, and employment. Hence, migration brings people closer to economic
opportunities. But some go to urban areas to access basic services, which should be provided even in the
remotest part of the province. Future strategy will install spatially blind services in Lanao del Sur to support
and prepare the mobile population wherever they prefer to settle. As one of the factors of production,
labor moves to where wages or returns are high. In the same vein, Mëranaw traders take advantage of
economically dense areas which secure businessmen and women relatively large markets. Labor
migration aids the concentration of economic activities in a few areas.
The Mëranaws are firmly rooted in their hometowns. They return to their municipalities of origin at least
once a year or on important occasions such as during the fasting season in the month of Ramadhan. A
repeated cycle of temporary migration defines the province’s transient population. Bringing with them
are capital, skills, and innovations that Mëranaw émigrés have acquired in major cities here and abroad.
These are missed opportunities that the province can harness to promote homegrown investments. The
latter will complement other domestic or foreign investments in key industries particularly in efforts to
modernize agriculture to achieve accelerated long-term growth and higher per capita incomes.
Forced migration due to natural or man-made calamities adds another layer of complexity to the social
dynamics in the province. Extreme events may displace the whole population. Local government units
(LGUs) of host communities may be strained to accommodate the newcomers as the former have to
address first the needs of their constituents.

22

Emergency response and rehabilitation are essential. The road to recovery entails accepting the displaced
population and providing them the space and dignity as a capable workforce. Their skills in trading and
strength of enterprising creativity can complement any post-disaster assistance and can fast track
rebuilding lives and the local economy.

4.3. Urbanizing World and Expanding Densification
Lanao del Sur is not flat. Urban population is expected to reach close to a million by 2040. Currently, some
530 thousand people are packed in just 12 percent of land in the Lanao del Sur. The twin economic forces
of migration and agglomeration are facts of life in the province. This will result in congestion of existing
small urban districts within Marawi, Malabang, Saguiaran, and Wao, and Tamparan. Rapid densification
of other municipalities has redrawn the socio-economic geography of the province with many emerging
urban or peri-urban areas dispersed across Lanao del Sur. Urbanization used to be the monopoly of
Marawi. It started out from the old Dansalan, and it has expanded to the rest of the city with tricentric
district structure. These are: the market-led old Dansalan, the government-push Capitol and Bangon area,
and the academic-pull university district. Densification will continue to expand in nearby municipalities
and in coastal communities. Urban and dense areas will open an unprecedented range of opportunities
to residents and encourage urban growth but will also strain the environment if urbanization is not
properly managed. Urbanization also creates the condition for the fast transmission of diseases such as
the COVID-19 pandemic.
Economic growth in Lanao del Sur must benefit both the present and future generations. The province’s
mantra for economic development is to preserve what is ecologically valuable to allow high quality growth
which will be shared by all—present and the future. Environment and economic progress are a collective
responsibility.

4.4. Conflict and Polarized Identities
Lanao del Sur will be a frontrunner as a progressive, peaceful, and tolerant province in the BARMM by
2040. Driving this process is cultural revivalism (“Mëranaw-ness”) which highlights the celebration of rich
Mëranaw cultural traditions and fading value system that promote community tolerance and
engagements. Communal conflict pervades all corners of the province. Competition over honor,
resources, and space characterize rido and they often twine clan politics. The changed world order in the
Middle East and the West has significantly polarized religious and sectarian identities. Some scholars,
students, and migrants sent abroad imported cultural and non-secular ideals and the politics that comes
with them from the Middle East, North Africa, and Central and South Asia. Old Mëranaw traditions have
been muted by shifting identities. What the province sees in the next two decades is to highlight the
authentic Mëranaw values and traditions as a moral compass for progress and inclusivity. These are
grounded on the Islamic teachings on tolerance, peace, and progress to prevent further social divisions.
Members of other ethnic or religious groups who live, study, or work in Lanao del Sur and who are part of

24

the transient population will continue to engage productively with the majority as was the tradition during
the heyday of the highly tolerant Lanao del Sur from the 1950s to the 1980s.
Like many urbanizing and emerging economies, Lanao del Sur is facing an urbanization dilemma. While it
has potential for wealth and opportunity creation, rapid urbanization creates a condition for conflict.
Disparities in the standard of living inherent at the initial stage of its economic development will be the
main source of social tension. Conflict lengthens distance, promotes division, and reduces economic
density of affected communities. Hence, the province will provide spatially-blind institutions and will
create opportunities in the agriculture sector. The province will pursue agriculture modernization to
benefit the great many and will embark on value creation as a strategy. Urban areas will play a major role
in economic development as will the peripheries and rural areas. Infrastructure development will not only
address economic linkage and connectivity, but also tackle common structures and spaces that promote
engaging interaction—not isolation nor suspicion.
Conflict is costly and painful. The recent conflict in Marawi City brought the economy and its physicality
to trepidation. It consequently aided the violent transformation of the urban landscape and its
relationship with rural areas and other prosperous cities outside the province. The urban structure shifted
from monocentric to polycentric districts—many emerging dominant business and employment centers
are enveloping the radial and periphery municipalities.

4.5. A Changed Climate System
Global warming is threatening the natural and human ecosystem. A 1.5 Celsius rise in the trajectory of
global temperature by 2030 and increasingly so by 0.2 degree Celsius every decade, according to the UN
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, is the upper limit that the planet can tolerate before
it succumbs to a global catastrophe. Lanao del Sur is not spared by the greenhouse effect. Its coastal
communities in the southwest are exposed to rising sea level. Its inland communities once surrounded by
a thick forest canopy are seeing depleting natural resources. Global warming is changing the micro-climate
of the fragile ecosystem of the province. Lake Lanao, one of the ancient lakes in the world from which the
vibrant culture of the Mëranaws emerged, is rapidly receding for the past three decades. A changed
climate system strains water availability, reduces forest biomass, increases acidification of water bodies,
and surges heat waves particularly in urban areas and surrounding rural areas. These scenarios will tip the
balance towards rife food shortage, economic downward spiral, and community violence arising from
competition of common and precious resources. Lanao del Sur must balance its development trajectory
with respect to the natural carrying capacity of the environment. Risk preparation and risk management
will prominently factor into the economic calculus of planning and investments.

4.6. Digitized World
The world is getting smaller and rapidly connected. Lanao del Sur shall take advantage of the opportunities
presented by increased digitization and connected world. The province will invest in fast internet
connection and mobile communication across the province by 2040 to aid economic productivity, access
global markets, and improve the living standards of each household.

26

Chapter 5: Spatial Framework

I

mplementation of the Vision and aims of the PDPFP requires a Spatial Framework to enable strategic
choices to be made relation to economic, service delivery, governance, and infrastructure investment
in Lanao del Sur, not only by government actors but also private investors. The components of the
Framework were initially identified by the Provincial economic team and validated through participatory
mapping exercises and consultations with stakeholders. While many of the issues and opportunities
discussed in the framework refers to fundamental service delivery gaps that are addressed by existing
policy, the Spatial Framework and its implications point to the need for new ‘game changer’ investments
to better achieve sustainable development in the interest of future generations of Mëranaws.
The guiding principle of the Spatial Framework is that any development must be informed by the
relationship between people and the places where they live, work, and access services. This includes
understanding the hierarchy of settlements and related infrastructure that exists not only within the
province but with other neighboring agglomerations. The key issues which influenced the Spatial
Framework within the PDPFP are:

● The importance of the metropolitan area centered on Marawi City and the adjacent spillover

●
●

●
●

●

municipalities such as Saguiaran and Marantao as the driver of economic growth in the province.
The massive displacement of over three hundred thousand people after the 2017 Marawi siege
has serious implications on the spatial development of the province, including the economic
displacement of people, trade, and services towards Iligan, Cagayan de Oro, and other cities
within Mindanao and as far away as the Visayas and Luzon. However, Marawi remains the regional
and provincial center for administration, commerce, education, health, and other forms of
specialized service delivery—making the completion of Marawi rehabilitation and reconstruction
a major priority.
The significant role of the agro-industrial corridor on the southwestern side of the province,
especially coastal towns such as Malabang, in generating growth
The importance of key centers and corridors in the eastern side of the province such as the Basak
area and the commercial crops corridors including secondary growth centers in Wao and Amai
Manabilang. These corridors are well-placed to contribute to Lanao del Sur economic growth, and
that critical mass to attract growth and ensure the equitable delivery of basic services can be
reached by supporting clusters of settlements outside Metropolitan Marawi.
The role of Lake Lanao and its status as a protected area as the anchor and limit of all physical
development in the province, as well as the basis of Mëranaw culture and identity.
The need to invest in sustainable transport, energy, and communications infrastructure that can
support connectivity and the equitable flow of goods and basic services across the province and
surrounding areas; and
The importance in all aspects of forward planning to support community peace and security and
address the consequences of climate change and increased disaster vulnerability. The increasing

human and environmental threats mean that there should be a clearer risk management lens as
Lanao del Sur’s residents determine where and how they live and work, and how the government
and the private sector can help citizens mitigate these risks.

5.1. Existing Land Use and Trend
5.1.1. Existing Land Use
The Spatial Framework is informed by and, in turn, will inform the preparation of municipal and city-level
Land Use Plans.
In preparation for more rigorous provincial land use computations, the map to and table below show
initial existing land use percentages per municipality as of 1st Quarter 2020 based on digitized satellite
imagery on OpenStreetMap (OSM), broken down as forestland, grassland/agricultural areas, and
residential or built-up areas. [Refer to Table 5 and Map 2]
This route was chosen given technical issues with 2012 NAMRIA data and 2002 DENR land cover data.
Note that the problem of overlapping physical boundaries due to conflicting data of national
government is true ACROSS THE COUNTRY, and hence is NOT unique to Lanao del Sur. Upon inspection
of available datasets, land cover data does not fit/correspond to the existing coastlines of administrative
boundaries and SRTM90 including a very large offset with coastline observed in the lake area. Other land
cover features do not correspond to satellite imagery in Google Earth/Maps, i.e. maps from different
sources are irreconcilable. (The SRTM90 or the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission is an international
research effort that obtained and studied the topographic database of the earth). [Refer to Map 3] Simply
replacing the built-up areas will produce gaps in the map or disregard supposedly existing built-up areas.
As of 2020, only seven out of 39 municipalities and cities have updated CLUPs and current land use maps.
Only one has been approved.
Much of these issues can be traced to the long-standing history of land contestation in the region. In
contemporary times, this translates to a sizable number of overlapping claims between municipalities and
barangays, and specific cases such as the military reservation in Marawi City. The broader environmental
governance issues between the BARMM and Central Government around the Lake Lanao watershed,
which is considered a protected area under the National Integrated Protected Areas System (NIPAS),
creates another layer of technical and political complexity for assessing land use in Lanao del Sur. These
overlaps are negatively incentivized by the inclusion of land area in the computation of Internal Revenue
Allotment, as well as a robust informal land market. Given these issues, official PSA-NAMRIA boundaries
are cited by the PDPFP but must be updated pending the official release of the regional cadastral survey
which has yet to be released by DENR-National despite being completed in the Aquino administration.

28

OSM however, has existing land use coverage of the area and just needs to be completed. Thus, a decision
to use OSM data was made, with a higher level of product accuracy and do-ability justifying the approach.
In a nutshell, this process involved the following steps:7
(i) Digitizing built-up areas
(ii) Integrating data on built-up area into existing OSM forest data
(iii) Subtracting forest cover and built-up areas from general map to generate grassland and
agricultural land; and
(iv) Computing provincial land use percentages

5.1.2. Trends
Given the lack of reliable historical data on land use in the province, it is difficult to provide a quantitative
assessment of land use trends. However, other existing studies and local knowledge point to increasing
urbanization in Lanao del Sur, which is tied not only to traders’ mobility within the province but to other
areas nationwide and globally.
This is partially discussed in the Chapter 2, which describes how the expansion of the trade sector in Lanao
del Sur in the 80s and 90s gave way to localization of economies in few urban districts and higher
specialization in wholesale and retail trade and commerce. Craftsmen and traders required the services
of financiers, logisticians, laborers, administrators, drafters, restaurant management workers, and tour
guides. In the process, it diversified the service sector of the local economy. Migration, trade, and
urbanization in Marawi and Malabang ensued paving way for the emergence of the middle class with high
earning capacity. Tamparan, Balindong (Watu), and Pualas-Ganassi positioned themselves as transit
municipalities. As a result, property prices shot up in Marawi. City size expanded. Settlements continued
to swell up in towns adjacent to the capital, namely Marantao, Saguiaran, Bubong, and Balindong (Watu).
[Refer to Map 4] At the same time, marked land conversion and deforestation occurred, except for
selected highland areas vulnerable to conflict.

5.2. Physical / Spatial Framework
5.2.1. The Current and Dated Territorial Model of Lanao del Sur
Lanao del Sur was designated as the center of Mindanao at the turn of the 1900s, with Marawi City tagged
as the kilometer-zero of the entire islands. While being the geographic center, its topographic landscape—
the province perched on top of an extinct volcano and bounded by mountain ridges—prevented Lanao
del Sur to become the center of economic trade of Mindanao.
Its settlements are concentrated in few Marawi City, Malabang, Marantao, Saguiaran, Tamparan, and
Wao, and some are dispersed across the rural landscape of the province. At present, the province has 39
municipalities and Marawi City, its capital located to the northern tip of the lake and with few major roads
fanning out towards Iligan City. The latter is the lowland capital and a former industrial city of Lanao del
Norte. About one-third of Lanao del Sur's inhabitants reside in just five towns (Marantao, Saguiaran,
Balindong [Watu], Ditsaan-Ramain, and Bubong) and Marawi City. And about 10 percent of inhabitants
are concentrated in the coastal areas to the southwest of the lake. Its enclave in Wao has less than five
percent of the total number of inhabitants of the province.
The territory of Lanao del Sur presents a linear pattern of occupation where businesses, offices, and
residences are lined along the major highways and thoroughfares. The concentration of infrastructure in
very few areas, notably in the capital and surrounding areas, has allowed compacted forms of traditional
settlements, where urban structures generally hug each other resulting in massive congestions in major
arterial nodes. Areas with little infrastructure have dispersed settlements despite the attractiveness of
their natural landscape.
Apart from the physical and settlement forms, the province is divided into two legislative districts.
Consisting of 16 towns and Marawi City, the 1st District is bounded by Piagapo and Marantao to the west
of lake Lanao; Saguiaran, Kapai, and Tagoloan II to the north, and all the way to Masiu, Maguing,
Bumbaran (Amai Manabilang) and Wao to the southeast. The concentration of major urban, transport,
economic, and social infrastructures have produced high population densities in Marawi City as the
urbanized center, and in its surrounding municipalities have impelled a certain degree of diluted
suburbanization. The town of Tamparan is a peri-urban area which traced its history as an old settlement
engaged in trade and public transport serving the municipalities in the eastern portion of the province.
The rest of Lanao del Sur comprise the 2nd District: the 23 municipalities forked in the mountainous area
of Butig to the south of lake Lanao and Balindong (Watu) to the west, sliding down to the coastal areas of
Picong (Sultan Gumander), Malabang, Balabagan, and Kapatagan. Malabang is an old settlement and a
staging point during the US military campaign against the locals at the dawn of the 20th century. It is now
a secondary growth and urban center of the province, connected to the Narciso Ramos National Highway
leading to Maguindanao province and the Zamboanga peninsula. Malabang finds its economic affinity to

34

Marawi but more so to its neighbors in Lanao del Norte, Maguindanao and Cotabato City. Except for the
coastal areas, the municipalities of the second district have dispersed settlements in largely rural areas.
In summary, Lanao del Sur has a dense urban center in Marawi City and an evolving urban fringe in
surrounding municipalities. Its secondary growth area in the coast evolved but has not fully maximized its
geographic support to the capital. Wao has been an economically prosperous ethnic enclave and its
relative isolation presents a challenge for the province to tap its potential. Sandwiched between these
three small urban poles are patches of relatively less inhabited peripheries. They are supported by one
concentric highway that gave rise to linear settlements compacted along the major routes and at the
mouth of the lake.
The infrastructure development onwards that pursued concreting of major roads around the lake towards
the late 1980s paved the way for cheaper transportation, but it also led residents to abandon their long
heritage of lake-based transport system. Because many of these roads were built with one or two lanes,
the province is not able to ease movements of goods and people at the optimum level.
Thus, the current territorial model of Lanao del Sur is unable to efficiently respond to urban challenges
posed by the tri-center and periphery relationship, characterized as disconnected at the very least, failing
to spur economic growth and maintain territorial balance at the most.

5.2.2. “Invisible” Boundaries
Lanao del Sur has to deal with eight “invisible” boundaries, which have profound effects on its ability to
achieve physical and economic integration. [Refer to Map 5] These invisible barriers correspond to
different jurisdictions and catchment areas, which encompass the physical and sectoral or thematic
dimension:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Geo-political administrative division: 39 municipalities and one city
Legislative districts: two districts
Functional, economic, and spatial (proposed) clusters: five corridors
Basic education administration: three school divisions
Health administration: seven health districts (including Integrated Provincial Health Office)
Security: two areas of responsibilities (one under Maguindanao province)
Cultural: four principalities (overlapping Lanao del Norte province)
Electricity distribution: three districts or franchise area (overlapping Lanao del Norte province) of
the Lanao del Sur Electric Cooperative; two municipalities in Lanao del Sur are served by the First
Bukidnon Electric Cooperative.

New insights from a generation of analysis suggest that these types of implicit barriers increases
coordination, restricts movements of factors of production, and stifles economies of scale.

5.2.3. The Proposed Spatial Model of Lanao del Sur
The Spatial or Physical Framework sets the direction for Lanao del Sur’s ideal spatial development in the
next twenty years including the roles and functions of its component municipalities. [Refer to Map 6] The
Spatial Framework has the following components:
●
●
●
●
●
●

Metropolitan Marawi
Agro-industrial corridor
Basak / Rice granary corridor
Commercial crops corridor
Lake Lanao area
Gateways and corridors

The proposed metropolitan area will be the center of employment, trade, and commerce. The service
sector, that includes banking and finance, logistics and transportation, and administration, will gravitate
towards the metropolitan area to support the modern sector. Because of their natural and physical
advantages (e.g. natural harbor), coastal towns will accommodate light to medium industries of
agricultural processing for products destined to domestic and international markets. These communities
will experience profound changes as the location of the transit economy of value-laden goods and people.
The rest of Lanao del Sur will be clustered as suppliers of complementary agricultural products destined
to the coastal towns for processing into high value commodities.

The ultimate objective is to create an ecosystem of integrated municipalities along the supply value chain.
The strategy is to create an environment that will allow economic breakthrough in one or two industries.
Once the industry breaks into the domestic and global markets, it can lead to spillover to other industries
and sectors. Premium is given to agricultural products uniquely identifiable as Lanao del Sur’s very own,
subject to the dictates of the market. Tourism and culture will play a vital role to showcase the collective
identity of the province and the uniqueness, not differences, of each municipality. Infrastructure,
institutions, social services, peace and security, physicality, and targeted interventions will buttress the
prospects of spatially and economically integrated province. This economic and spatial arrangement will
support the population base both in urban and rural areas and will encourage accelerated rate of
economic convergence or catch-up.
To achieve the province’s vision of peace and prosperity, efforts should be made to address disparities in
living standards and access to services, which manifests itself spatially and exacerbates social tensions.
The role of cultural heritage as a deposit of several centuries of evolution of the monumental relationship
of the people and the territory will play a vital role in Lanao del Sur’s pursuit of sustainable peace and
economic development. The PDPFP, if implemented, will lead to a shift from a monocentric (Marawibased) to a polycentric (multiple corridor and growth center) spatial regime, where business and
employment opportunities can be supported along the radial and periphery municipalities.
The Spatial Framework is therefore a grounded provincial economic clusters system, which acknowledges
the roles and comparative advantages of each subcluster of municipalities. As part of Lanao del Sur’s
commitment to development that acknowledges the unique culture and ecology of the province, the
Spatial Framework also factors in cultural clusters and significant sites, including pre-colonial spatial
governance arrangements related to traditional leadership and the Pat a Pängampong a Ranaw (the four
Principalities of Lanao). These are discussed further in subsequent sections on the Environment,
Economic, and Cultural Development in Chapter 6.
As the process of urbanization and increased densification continues, uneven growth will initially
characterize the local economy of the province. Labor intensive industries such as light to medium
manufacturing and the service sector will emerge as the core structure of the local economy of urban and
highly settled areas. Urban-rural inequality is inevitable at the initial stage of economic development of
Lanao del Sur but this spatial inequality will dissipate over time through appropriate strategies. More
agricultural production in rural areas will be encouraged to sustain its population and that of the growing
urban population. This can be done through agricultural modernization. As both rural and urban
production improves, so will opportunities, returns to production, earnings access to capital, new
technology, skills, and services.
In addition, urban-rural migration helps to mitigate the difference in welfare that accompanies economic
concentration provided a good mix of policies and programs are instituted. The feedback loop will
encourage a spillover of economic growth to neighboring towns and municipalities. The roles of
Vision 2040

Lanao del Sur PDPFP

39

connective infrastructure, basic services, responsive institutions, and targeted interventions will
prominently play a vital role in bridging the urban and rural divide.
To ensure that spatial development contributes to peacebuilding, this means that policymakers must have
a more sensitive and judicious approach to the use of land, by supporting the local economies of
settlements around the lake instead of the unconscious funneling of resources and capital away from
these communities, and to other cities such as Iligan, Cagayan de Oro, and beyond, with Metropolitan
Marawi as an interim transit point particularly given its current state.
In the short term, this means ensuring food security and trade links within the province to help grow Lanao
del Sur’s rural districts, and accelerating the reconstruction of Marawi City’s destroyed urban core. In the
medium-term, this can be supported by enhancing connectivity within and among the provincial enclaves
such as Wao and identifying expansion areas for future innovative industries.

5.3. Metropolitan Marawi
The Metro Marawi cluster is defined as the continuous built-up area centered on the Islamic City of
Marawi, its adjacent municipalities of Marantao and Saguiaran, as well as the arc stretching across
Balindong (Watu), Ditsaan-Ramain, Bubong, and Buadiposo-Buntong. [Refer to Map 7] It is the center of
Commerce, Trade, and Education of Lanao del Sur and is the gateway for subregional transport and trade
for most communities around Lake Lanao. With the destruction of the urban core of Marawi City in 2017,
many of these economic activities have been partially displaced to the neighboring cities of Iligan and
Cagayan de Oro as well as other towns within Lanao del Sur.

5.4. Agri-industrial Corridor
This area covers the corridor of municipalities in from the northwest to the southwest side of Lake Lanao,
stretching from Piagapo, Madalum, Bacolod Kalawi, Madamba, Pualas, to the lakeside municipalities of
Ganassi, Binidayan, Bayang, Lumbatan, Lumabayanague, Calanogas, Pagayawan, Tubaran, Marogong
Sultan Dumalondong, and down to the coastal areas of Picong, Malabang, Balabagan, and Kapatagan,
leading to the neighboring province of Maguindanao. [Refer to Map 8] In terms of built-up area and
economic activity, Malabang is the dominant secondary growth area in this zone, bolstered by the
presence of plantation crops and traditional ports leading up to Picong.

5.5. Basak Corridor
These are the traditional rice production areas and wetlands in the eastern side of Lake Lanao, stretching
from the lakeside municipalities of Mulondo, Taraka, Tamparan, to Poona Bayabao, Maguing, and LumbaBayabao, as well as gradually higher-elevation areas in Masiu and Butig. [Refer to Map 9]

40

5.6. Commercial Crops Corridor
These areas include Amai Manabilang (Bumbaran) and Wao on the southeastern side of the province, as
well as northeast municipalities of Kapai and Tagoloan, which are sites of agricultural plantations with
trade links to Bukidnon and other neighboring areas outside Lanao del Sur. [Refer to Map 10]

5.7. Lake Lanao
Special emphasis is placed on Lake Lanao and the surrounding watershed, which is of major
environmental, economic, and cultural significance not only for Lanao del Sur but for the BARMM and the
Philippines as a whole. [Refer to Map 11]

5.8. Towards a Physically Integrated Lanao del Sur
Implementing the Spatial Framework and the necessary infrastructure to realize its potential will facilitate
better access to services and facilities, not only for those living in Marawi and other sub provincial growth
centers, but also spatially dispersed population.
It will also provide opportunities for the province to work with neighboring provinces and municipalities
in BARMM and other regions. At present, this covers the four major gateways or entry points to the
province, namely (i) the northern route traversing the Saguiaran towards Iligan City, Lanao del Norte via
Iligan- Marawi Road; (ii) the northeastern route covering the Wao and Bumbaran (Amai Manabilang)
towards Kalilangan in Bukidnon via the Wao-Kalilangan Road; (iii) the southern route traversing the
Kapatagan towards Matanog in Maguindanao via the Cotabato-Lanao Road; and (iv) the southwestern
gateway from Picong (Sultan Gumander) towards the Sultan Naga Dimaporo in Lanao del Norte via
Malabang-Tukuran Road leading to the Zamboanga peninsula.
The potential expansion transport links to support connectivity within and around Lanao del Sur and
neighboring provinces are described in Map 12.

Chapter 6: Strategies for Development
6.1. Core Elements and Spatial Translation of Strategies

T

his chapter provides long term policy direction to guide the public, private, and community
sectors, based on an analysis of historical and emerging trends in population, economic activity,
and physical resources. [Refer to Figure 3] While government programming tends to adhere to
sectoral silos and line agency mandates and budget items, the value of the spatial approach espoused by
the PDPFP is that it is able to support a cross-cutting, area-based approach to addressing the Issues,
challenges, and opportunities facing and accompanying the task of accomplishing the identified
development goals, objectives and targets of the Province.
Figure 3. Core Elements of the PDPFP

Source: PLPEM Vol. 2 (2007) based on Losch (1954) and Jones (1983)

While the Strategies for Development discussed in this Chapter and the resulting PPAs are listed down by
sector, final implementation should be guided by and tailored to the specific geographic clusters
(Metropolitan Marawi, the Agro-industrial corridor, the Basak / Rice granary corridor, the Commercial
crops corridors, Lake Lanao area, and the provincial Gateways and corridors) of the Physical/Spatial
framework spelled out in Chapter 5. To do so, an understanding of managing the relationship between
urban growth, economic activity, and the limits of available resources will have two specific implications
in order to have a coherent approach to LDS development: (i) managing spatial inequality by linking cores
and clusters, and (ii) ensuring that spatial development supports peacebuilding and social cohesion.

6.2 Strategies for Population and Settlements: Managing the Growing Province
In order to realize the vision, mission, and articulated agenda for Lanao del Sur’s development, the
Provincial Government is committed to a Strategic Framework that encompasses priority development
goals, desired outcomes, and the necessary strategic initiatives to achieve them. [Refer to Table 6]
Apart from the core elements required by the PLPEM guidelines (Population, Economic Activity, Physical
Resources, Income/Access to Services, and Land Use), additional elements that are fundamental to
development in Lanao del Sur are included. These are Governance, Peace and Security, and Culture.
Disaster Risk reduction and Management is included as a subcomponent of the physical resources and
land use sectors, and necessarily informs all other sectors. Specific discussions on transport, energy, and
communications are included in the Infrastructure section.
Note: Impact, outcome, and output statements as well as the final programs, projects, and activities
(PPAs) are fleshed out in Book 3.

6.3 Creating an Environment Friendly Province
6.3.1 Overview of Issues and Strategies: Environment
Lanao del Sur is the center of Mëranaw culture and where the Lake Lanao is situated. Lake Lanao and its
surrounding environs have shaped and is still continuing to shape the Mëranaw culture and society. Aside
from Lake Lanao, places like Bumbaran are sang in the Mëranaw epic Darangën while Malabang
(translated as Loud Adhaan) was where Sharief Kabungsuwan supposedly landed. The richness of the soil
and abundance of water in the floodplains of Basak helped create the Sultanate of Masiu. Presently, small
industries such as gravel and sand mining in the waters of Masiu River have grown exponentially as well
as those of in Malabang while the Lake Lanao and Agus River has been providing food, water, electricity
and jobs to the people of Ranaw.
Despite existing national policies for the environment that are applicable to the province, many areas in
the province are blighted with environmental issues [Refer to Table 7 and Map 13]

The Bangsamoro Organic Law was ratified by President Duterte last 2019 and it is hoped to bring peace
and development to the provinces under BARMM. However, the people of Lanao del Sur and the whole
BARMM must ask “What good is the Bangsamoro autonomy if there will be no land to grow our plants to,
and no water to swim to?” It is therefore imperative upon the people of Lanao del Sur to promote, protect
and preserve the natural environment while balancing the need and demand of the people for socioeconomic growth.
Lanao del Sur’s goal for the environment is be guided by the country’s Sustainable Development Goals
[SDGs] aside from the Islamic core values , regional and national policies. According to the Philippine
Sustainable Development Goals, we should strive to “ensure availability and sustainable management of
water and sanitation for all” [SDG 6], “ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern
energy for all’ [SDG 7], “make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable” [
SDG 11], “take urgent action to combat climate change and its impact” [SDG 13], “conserve and
sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development’ [SDG 14], and
“protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests,
combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss” [SDG 15].
By 2040, the people of Lanao del Sur will be responsible stewards to its environment through creating and
implementing fact-based environmental policies, and protecting its protected areas grounded on Islamic
principles and values.

6.3.2. Rehabilitating, Protecting, and Managing the Watershed
The province shall properly manage, protect and rehabilitate the Lake Lanao – Agus River Basin and other
small watershed within the boundaries of the province
The rehabilitation of watersheds within Lanao del Sur will have an overall positive impact on the lives of
its constituents.
Rehabilitation entails fast-tracking the approval of the Provincial Environmental Code for the enactment
of ordinances and enforcement/implementation of laws, rules and regulations. The best approach to
rehabilitate and restore the LLRB and its environs, the Province Local Government Unit shall enter a
memorandum of agreement with the DENR for co-management in the Lake Lanao watershed invoking
JMC 98-01 as amended and other existing policies.
Empowering the Lake Lanao Development Council is vital to oversee the protection of Lake Lanao or lobby
for the legislation of the Lake Lanao Development Authority (LLDA), similar to Laguna Lake Development
Authority. Various LGUs and government agencies have overlapping management and policy roles in
developing Laguna de Bay however a solution was done by enacting the Laguna Lake Development
Authority. Lake Lanao is in a similar dilemma also since there are overlapping management and policy
56

roles in developing and managing Lake Lanao i.e. NAPOCOR, PDLGU, MLGUs, MENRE – BARMM, DENR. It
is hoped that the creation of a Lake Lanao Development Authority will streamline development policy and
management of the lake. This action is endorsed by several agencies and technical plans as per Philippine
Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 2015–20188 and Integrated River Basin Management and
Development Masterplan: Ranao (Agus) River Basin9
Establishing linkages with foreign or local institutions advocating on concerned in
environmental/watershed protection and development will help leverage the local resources. This is
important to foster cooperation among institutions and agencies on the protection and rehabilitation of
the province’s environment.
The province will pursue efforts on rehabilitating degraded portions of the watersheds through proper
reforestation programs. A watershed reforested with appropriate flora will vastly decrease soil erosion,
decrease siltation and will help increase the water holding capacity of the watershed especially the
groundwater reservoirs.
The province will improving implementation of environmental laws and ordinances.
Building the capacity of local enforcers, e.g. park rangers, MENRE, PNP and possibly AFP personnel, will
boost the province’s initiatives to prevent illegal encroachment on protected areas.
And, lastly, the province will implementing the total log ban and show the spiritual and moral dimensions
toward protection of the ecology and environment through dissemination of Information Education
Campaigned materials and conduct of multi-sectoral training.

6.3.3. Monitoring the Natural Capital
The LGU and the community will need to implement regular monitoring and evaluation natural resources
of LDS such as the surface water, groundwater, the forests, and the wetlands.
The province and local LGUs will establish river monitoring sites on rivers such as those in Taraka River,
Masiu River, Malabang River among others. To gain traction, there will be capacity building measures
involving local stakeholders in the monitoring and evaluation of natural resources.
A long-term partnership between PLLDS and MSU on the river and lake water quality monitoring will boost
the technical side of monitoring the environment. Proposals include habitats within and outside the Lake
Lanao watershed. Such partnership will take advantage of the university’s skilled researchers as well as
the network of satellite campuses within the province.

6.3.4. Proper Regulation of Mining and Other Natural Resources
The Lanao del Sur LGU established the Provincial Mining Regulatory Board (PMRB). It is still awaiting
approval by the Sangguniang Panlalawigan through a resolution on procedural guidelines to regulate and
constitute policy on the collection of sand, boulder, cobbles and gravels.
The LGU will assess and evaluate mining resources in the province with the help of DENR–MGB and the
Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources, and Energy (MENRE) of BARMM.

6.3.5. Promoting Alternative Livelihood
The LGUs and the community will identify and implement livelihood alternatives for illegal loggers,
poachers and kaingin farmers to end once and for all the desecration of the ecological assets of the
province. The following are identified options for the province and local LGUs.
●

●
●
●
●

●

Mitigation/elimination of kaingin practices (open burning of trees and grass to give way for
cultivation) through opening alternative opportunities for farmers and fisher folks to strengthen
diversify and sustain their livelihood.
Promotion of organic agriculture and agri-forestry
Explore non-timber forest products and capacity-building on processing of renewable timber
substitutes e.g. bamboo, rattan
Regulating/certification of timber products (used by okir artisans) harvested are from sustainable
trees
Introduce sustainable farming practices. Kaingin is done by farmers due to nutrient depletion in
previous farm lands. Sustainable farming practices such as multi-cropping and Sloped Agricultural
Land technology will mitigate and may even prevent kaingin practices.
Promote ecotourism in the province

6.3.6. Improve DRR and CCA Practices
There is a need for the installation, operation and maintenance of additional automatic weather stations
(AWS). Lanao del Sur’s topography is highly mountainous which makes rainfall data spatially variable.
DOST–PAGASA maintains one weather station in MSU - Marawi City. It would be beneficial to have one
AWS in the Basak area, one in the coast of Malabang and 7-10 AWS distributed on the mountainous areas
of the province. [Refer to Table 9]

The province LGU shall explore the use of both “hard” and “soft” approach in controlling scouring of river
banks. Use hard approach such as river channelization on relatively fast-growing communities like in
Malabang, Ramain and Taraka. More “soft” projects as they are more environment-friendly such as those
in upstream parts of rivers. Examples of “soft” approaches are lining river banks with bamboo trees and
other natural riprap.
Flooding can be hardly controlled especially when there is high rainfall intensity in the floodplains however
its impact can be decreased. First is to have ecological-controls upstream. This means increasing forest
cover as earlier explained. Decreasing soil erosion and increasing water holding capacity can be done by
implementation proper reforestation programs and prevention of deforestation especially near the
headwaters of Lake Lanao tributaries. Doing so will also minimize the downward speed of river flow which
greatly contributes to erosion at river bends. Second is to create a land-use plan especially in urban
communities and growth centers that will not aggravate the impact of flooding.
The province and constituent municipalities and city will need to invest training their disaster risk
reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation (CCA) personnel and capacity development. Efforts to
increase the role of the communities in DRR and CAA.

6.3.7. Protect and Conserve the Province’s Biodiversity
The LGU will identify and protection of critical biodiversity areas. LDS is home to endemic flora and fauna
as well as endangered species such as the Philippine eagle and the Philippine freshwater crocodile.
A bio-genetic survey will be helpful in assessing the extent of protection of the local biodiversity in the
province. Creation of permanent ecological research project in partnership with MSU-Marawi and/or
other research agencies. This includes regular biodiversity assessment of LDS.
A balanced program on biodiversity conservation and the development of potential ecotourism sites in
the province are seen as options.
Aside from information campaign, engaging the communities through organizing and supporting local
hobby groups (birder’s association, mountaineering groups, mountaineering club, e.g. Ranao
Kapanakedeg) increases the traction of instilling awareness among locals and enthusiasts to track
ecological assets.

6.3.8. Mitigate Environmental and Health Hazards Due to Municipal Solid Waste (MSW)
The Lanao del Sur LGU shall require its constituent LGUs to submit their respective 10-year MSW plan as
per National Solid Waste Management Commission (NSWMC-EMB). This will include identifying possible
dumpsite/ landfill location and may also contain clustering of MSW collection.

6.4 Building the Economic Future
6.4.1. Overview of Issues and Strategies: Economy
Lanao del Sur will endeavor a modern and forward-looking market economy, by 2040, that is rooted in its
core capabilities in agriculture, trade and commerce, and tourism. It will be a leading food basket and an
investment destination of sustainable agriculture and modern industry to leverage food production,
robust service sector, and an eco-cultural tourism marvel in Central and Northern Mindanao. The local
economy will strive to offer high value products and services and will utilize modern and indigenous
technologies attuned to the ecological capacity. A well-functioning labor market with an adequate supply
of skilled professionals and technicians will support the province in achieving its economic potential.
In agriculture, the rural population will be mobilized towards self-reliant communities and transformed
into a productive and better rural citizenry. Its farm resources will be maximized into viable opportunities
for sustained modern agriculture and business growth. The province also aims to cultivate the next
generation of family farmers. Today’s youth are tomorrow’s dignified family farmers and maintaining
interest in farming and food production as a profession is vital to future food security. The province needs
to ensure that young people have access to markets, goods and service, employment opportunities, and
leisure so that they want to stay on the farm. Lanao del Sur shall strive to build its position in the Philippine
map as an agriculture power, that is collectively managed by the local communities.
To guarantee wider participation of home-grown talents in the localization of economic activities, the
productive markets will necessitate public support for transformational innovations, startups, agricultural
entrepreneurship, and training and education suitable to the needs of the modern economy of Lanao del
Sur. The province will embrace the ethos that it will not develop by merely doing more of the same thing.
It will develop different things and it must do them better.

6.4.2. Specialization
Lanao del Sur’s economy consists of agriculture, services, and micro to small-scale manufacturing industry
which is confined to artisanal food and cultural artefact production, as well as small-scale construction
and sand mining. A host of business lines from retail trade to financial, personal and educational services
are concentrated in the capital and Malabang, being points of entry, as well as in few peri-urban areas to
support the market exchange of agriculture and tradable goods destined for consumption or for
intermediate production within and outside the province. The rest of Lanao del Sur is devoted to
cultivation of a limited number of crops, livestock, and fishery products.
The next 20 years will witness a burgeoning demand for goods and skills, particularly in agriculture,
because of the rapid rise of population and trend of urbanization. It is imperative for Lanao del Sur to
pursue specialization of goods and services based on its potentials and advantages to produce more
(quantity), better (quality), and cheaper (cost) products and service if the province is to compete with its
neighbors.
To pursue modern agriculture and agriculture-based industry and a robust service sector requires
developing and exploring business niches that have not yet been claimed by its neighbors—Bukidnon,
Northern Mindanao, and Maguindanao. A unique array of goods and services will ideally constitute the
“identity products” that reflect the terroir of Lanao del Sur, the growing conditions, and skills of the
artisans, farmers, technicians, and professionals—goods and services based on the province’s competitive
advantage and identity for the domestic and global markets. The hospitality or tourism industry, for
instance, shall have local culture and ecology as its primary anchor supported by appropriate
Vision 2040

|

Lanao del Sur PDPFP

63

environment-friendly infrastructures. The manufacturing industry shall base its primary production on
agriculture. To deepen specialization of tradable goods, the province shall pursue a strategy that promotes
diversification, i.e. having a variety of related industries, businesses, and livelihood located close to each
other in the product space to maximize export potentials.
Specialization paves way for expansion of production and incomes. The Mëranaws have seen the benefits
of heavy specialization in trade for the past few decades which raised their incomes and purchasing
power. Specialization can be replicated in agriculture and agriculture-based manufacturing which are
routes for economic growth and job creation. Further, the rise in consumer demand and population will
spur a boom in the service sector in particular financial services, transport services, housing, and personal
and recreation sector.
Specialization and diversification of related industries entail securing the value chain and adoption of
innovative (modern and indigenous) technologies to suit the evolving tastes and patterns of trade. A
cluster-approach will significantly help the local economy achieve economies of scale and economies span
of specialized goods and services, one that takes advantage of the localization of industries. Notably,
The Metropolitan Cluster will pose as the primary growth center of the province which will
specialize in commerce and trade, logistics, financial services, and education services of Lanao
del Sur. Marawi City is the nucleus of the metropolitan area.
The Agriculture-based Industrial Cluster will serve as the economic zone of the province where
industries will be organized to produce agriculture and fishery products. The cluster proposes to
accommodate export-oriented light to medium industries such as fish processing plants, coconut
mills and oleochemical processing plants, flour mills, industrial processing plants that extensively
make use of abaca as raw materials, cottage industries like brass wares, tool and die industry,
cosmetic industry (soap making), as well as Mëranaw native products. Some municipalities in the
cluster are suitable for the cultivation of indigenous crops such as sakurab, non-timber forest
products and exotic fruits, and fishery products like milutikan and bakas which will bring in a
whole industry of uniquely local food products domestic and international consumption.
The Basak Corridor or the Rice Granary Cluster refers to low-lying areas of the province by the
lake to the east of the proposed metropolitan area. Its fertile and vast track of land is suitable for
grain and livestock production. Organic and heirloom rice and other types of grains will create a
market niche for the province given the current scenario of low trade barriers of imported rice
adopted as a national policy, that has driven the market price down. Fowl production particularly
ducks is an opportunity that complements grain production.
The Commercial Crop Cluster will specialize in high value commercial crops such as cacao, coffee,
exotic fruits, pineapples, vegetables, and other cash crops.

64

At the micro level (i.e. firms and farms), an incentive-based organization of economic activities especially
for farm production may yet address the problem of underutilized use of agricultural land and limits of
subcontracting. This means that farming households and landowners will be encouraged to produce a
particular good, with high value content, which can be achieved by responding to twinned or “interlinked” incentives such as free access to a particular basic social services (i.e. pre-production) subject to
meeting the target volume set by the province. This is in addition to the traditional market incentives
created by profit motive through the price system (i.e. post-production). It is an ingenuous method of
organizing agricultural production in a setting where small landholding is prevalent, traditionally used for
household or backyard production, and where residents heavily relied on traditional means of land
ownership. The latter poses a challenge to generate a competitive volume of production of raw materials
for manufacturing and exports.
Further, to be successful, the province shall treat its economy inseparable to livelihood as opposed to a
mere mechanistic process of production and consumption. This means that the economy must highlight
its veritable relationship with the needs of the society and the environment. It must do away from
pursuing short-term growth industries such as the extractives including quarrying, sand mining, and
logging which are highly disruptive to the long-term stability of the community10 and highly adverse to
overall impacts on the ecology. The type of economic specialization that the province desires to pursue is
anchored on an enduring principle that allows the present generations to meet their needs without
compromising the ability of the future generations to meet theirs.

6.4.3. Local Advantages and Value Creation
Lanao del Sur’s greatest advantage is its natural endowment—the lake Lanao. A healthy lake and its
surrounding canopied forests, if managed correctly and sustainably, will confer future streams of benefits
to the quality of life of the residents and the local economy. Not to mention, the cool climate and the
natural scenery contribute to favorable business location once the infrastructures and the factors that
determine the cost of doing business including robust political economy are in place. The rich ecological
heritage of the province implies an important responsibility for the LGUs and the communities to adopt
an integrated approach to the management of the Lake. This means that agriculture and fishery, industry,
and services including transportation and tourism, as well as the consumption of goods and services, must
be sustainably embedded in managing the natural resource. Sustainable livelihood that defines the
relationship of the local communities to their environment and their ways of life shall be at the core of
the local economy.
The province’s geographic position has shaped the trading tradition of local residents, which is currently
inward-looking, i.e. bulk of goods being exchanged in the local market is imported from the rest of the
country or from abroad. Historically, the lake facilitated intra-province trade of primary or agricultural
goods and artisanal products, e.g. woven cloth, cultural artefacts, and home-produced food items, which

10

Vision 2040

Lanao del Sur PDPFP

65

continues to this day albeit at small volume. While very few goods locally grown or produced in the
province are exported to the rest of the country, the goal for the next 20 years is to transform the primary
orientation of the local economy to be outward-looking to encourage rapid income expansion. Viewed
strategically, Lanao del Sur can serve as an alternative gateway of Central Mindanao to Western Mindanao
through the routes along the coast of Illana Bay. The coastal area can evolve into a hub, inviting business
establishments to locate, once the province embarks on the construction and systematic operation of
transportation logistic facilities. Matling Industrial and Commercial Corporation (formerly, Matalin
Coconut Company, Inc.) was one of the early movers to Lanao del Sur, particularly in Malabang—one of
the coastal towns to the southwest of the proposed Metropolitan Marawi.
The physical geography alongside social and symbolic factors (e.g. asserting the collective Filipino Muslim
identity and addressing the “Mindanao problem”) encouraged providers of education services to locate
in Lanao del Sur. The presence of the Mindanao State University (formerly, University of Mindanao) which
was created through a national legislation in 1961 significantly contributed to the professionalization of
generations of local residents and dreamers from across Mindanao. Skilled labor force is Lanao del Sur’s
asset. Combined that with the Mëranaw’s predilection for trading activities is a lynchpin for future
employability and massive opportunities for entrepreneurship.
However, many professionals, technicians, and traders have chosen to sojourn in the Middle East as
overseas workers and in other parts of the Philippines to practice their craft. The challenge for Lanao del
Sur is to provide an attractive setting for the emigrant skilled workers and their families to come back
permanently and contribute to rebuilding the economy. This entails the province to embark on robust
business and livelihood opportunities and to install the right mix of transformative social and physical
infrastructures so that the resulting quality of life that their families and children will have in Lanao del
Sur will be at par with what they experience in other progressive places.
The accumulated skills, capital, and network are assets that the province can tap as essential factors of
production in certain industries. The province shall develop and strengthen the following industries that
are predicted to be critical if it wants to see profound economic restructuring and long-term growth for
the next 20 years. These are transportation logistics and telecommunication services, renewable energy
and water distribution, halal-based agriculture processing and food manufacturing, halal services,
financial services including microfinance, nature and tourism, environmental conservation, architecture
and urban management, and the health services. The strategy is to pool a critical mass of professionals
and technicians of at least 3 to 5 percent of the population to be employed in the critical industries to
jumpstart the economy. The critical mass will attract amenities and entice more livelihood and business
opportunities in downstream or related industries—which, as a result, will stave off the exodus of a
younger and skilled population in favor of working in Lanao del Sur. The province can only secure skilled
professionals to vote with their feet in favor of Lanao del Sur only when they see some prospects of a
robust economy that they can participate in.
To achieve better impacts, the province shall leverage its high concentration of educational institutions
compared to other areas in BARMM. A science-industry collaboration, to be called Ka’alim sa Ranaw
66

Consortia (Science in Lanao), will help nurture and expand the local economy. A combination of sciencepush and industry-pull approach to livelihoods will help influence the setting up of innovative enterprises
attuned to the present and future needs of the province, particularly in the areas of agriculture and food
technology; metallurgy and the arts; engineering technology, environment and urban architecture; among
others.
The halal-based industry is a confluence of Islam, science and technology (S&T), and business
management, which the province must vigorously invest in if it wants to participate in the multibilliondollar global industry. It encompasses the whole spectrum of the supply chain from sourcing of raw
materials to production, processing, logistics, marketing, and consumption. For a start, the province shall
install a common tap-up agriculture processing facility that conforms to the halal traditions, in every
cluster to benefit a great majority of households and business owners. This shall be complemented by
well-thought-out logistics transportation arrangements with nodes established in key strategic areas in
the province and connected to a processing hub in the Agri-Industrial Cluster, the Metropolitan Marawi,
and the major cities outside the province.
The proposed collaboration demonstrates that an inter-disciplinary and inter-departmental approach
spurs more creative thinking and innovations, and it paves way for business niches. It is even more
relevant now that unprecedented economic shocks including pandemics become frequent due to a
changed climate system and strong population pressures, whereby the province will have to conceive of
a new approach or process of organizing production and transportation to prevent any future dents in the
economy. The more Lanao del Sur unlocks economic opportunities in the future, the more it needs to
strengthen the quality of local research and development (R&D) efforts and technology transfers, which
come with more financial and human resources to the academe and private institutions. The Ka’alim sa
Ranaw will be the prime vehicle for the fast diffusion of technology to Lanao del Sur’s firms, particularly
the small and medium enterprises which have shown to be more adaptable and flexible. At the same time,
the province shall provide incentives for innovative enterprises and livelihoods to drive better
performance culture and to encourage local products to be top of the line in the Philippine and global
markets.
At the meso level, the province in collaboration with BARMM and the national government shall explore
the application of Geographic Indications for products unique to Lanao del Sur—ideally by specific cluster
of municipalities to leverage local production, to protect local producers from unfair competition, and to
add value or premium to farmers and local producers.

6.4.4. Supportive Business Environment
Lanao del Sur’s economic success will rest on its capacity to leverage resources and to pursue a strategy
of rapid catch-up. Underpinning the success will be the efforts of the government to deliver the essential
public goods and to exercise the political will to achieve the desired and shared goal of economic progress,

Vision 2040

|

Lanao del Sur PDPFP

67

regardless of clan or political affiliations. The following 5 broad economic policies are vital to create the
right environment for sustained economic growth.
6.4.4.1. Agriculture and Rural Development Policy
The province shall embrace food security and trade-focused policies, which will embody a competitive
and resilient agriculture sector to deliver long-term economic and social benefits. This can be achieved
through agricultural modernization and developing high quality agricultural chains, which require a
combination of hard and soft infrastructure investments.
Improving farming and production technologies, post-harvest infrastructures, consolidation and logistics
arrangements, utilities, irrigation, biosecurity, and agricultural research and development are crucial
interventions.
The current state of agriculture in Lanao del Sur necessitates direct support to farmers such as provision
of seedlings and equipment, only for a start, to build a critical mass of producers and to boost production.
However, any long-term efforts on farm input subsidies and price-related interventions such as price
control or price support, and artificially low cost of finance shall be shunned because it creates an
environment where farmers become less responsive to the market signals preventing them to be
competitive and to innovate, not discounting the fiscal burden to the local government. The only
exceptions are when an external crisis or emergency situation emerges and causes significant threat to
domestic or global demand and decline in local production, and when the local government provides
targeted hardship benefits, on equity grounds, to justify direct government intervention. But in no way
shall farmers be deprived of access to credit and crop insurance as these are essential to support local
production. Helping farmers and fishers learn livelihood options during off seasons will help in stabilizing
household incomes and in diversifying their income portfolios.
New platforms and models to address the skewed distribution of access to financial capital presents an
opportunity for rural development, that are market driven and consistent with local culture. Islamic
finance, particularly microfinance, will help free up the production of local farmers and small agribusiness
owners, which are otherwise captured by unscrupulous middlemen and traders. Improving financial
literacy and helping the local farmers and producers formalize their business operations are only few of
the financial inclusion strategies that the local government can implement in parallel with the existing
national or regional strategies. In the future, the introduction of financial innovations, also called fintech,
will help ease payment transactions and savings of local farmers in remote areas.
A new approach to farming management will significantly help rural households boost their production
that heavily borrows from Mëranaw’s tradition of entrepreneurship. The local government in
collaboration with the private sector shall introduce business management and business planning
approach to farming. In addition, the areas of agriculture product promotion and market linkage, gauging
business or market expectations, and quality monitoring to secure an efficient and reliable supply chain,
68

will be viable undertakings for public-private partnership. Concerted efforts of science and industry will
be useful in assisting farmers and agribusinesses in product development. The province must adopt an
incessant culture of value creation through the process of product development and finding market
niches.
To address market failures and to promote agribusiness, it is vital for the province to institute and adopt
responsive agricultural extension investments, local regulatory frameworks, incentivized innovations, and
agricultural R&D especially by private firms that are attuned to the market opportunities. The potential to
organize, develop, and manage agribusiness marketing exists to ensure that farmers and fishers will be
able to capture a substantial portion of value of products along the agribusiness chain.11 Too often, various
layers of intermediaries gnaw a large share of value at the expense of farmers and fishers.
Facing huge challenges from institutional constraints governing land ownership and land use, rising cost
of supplies, and changing consumer preferences and expectations, the agriculture sector must embark on
strategies to adopt and utilize environment-friendly agricultural technologies where some degree of
localization applies. The agricultural technologies that the province will explore spans from the traditional
such as floating farming to utilize the vast waterscape of Lanao del Sur and indigenous methods of
irrigation, soil conservation and pest control management (to address biotic and abiotic constraints) to
the modern such as greenhouse farming, all the way to ultra-modern like precision agriculture that
controls every aspect or every variable of farming. The pace of technological advancement in information
and technology (IT) and its application in the agriculture across the globe for the past few years has been
tremendous, and it is vital for the province to explore and make use of them if it wants to secure
agriculture as its competitive edge relative to its neighbors in BARMM and Northern Mindanao, and
potentially the rest of the country. Currently at the forefront of modern computing, blockchain
technology is gaining momentum in modern agriculture and will be the currency in the next 20 years to
trace the origin, safety, and supply chain efficiencies of food production.
6.4.4.2. Logistics Policy
The latter highlights a much broader need for the province to adopt a comprehensive and sound logistics
policy and invest in infrastructure development for an unimpeded flow of goods from production to
consumption. [Refer to Figure 4] Logistics which connects every aspect of the agriculture supply chain is
indispensable to Lanao del Sur’s growth and development. It encompasses systems, infrastructures, and
management operations not only involving transportation but also maintaining and tracking quantity,
quality, timing, and traceability of goods,12 especially perishable items along the supply chain. These are
embodied in three subsectors of logistics that the province must strengthen: transportation, contract
logistics, and freight forwarding.

Transportation costs have a significant effect on the competitiveness of companies, big or small, to serve
the market and the capacity of residents to find employment. A multi-modal transportation system that
provides comfortable, safe, reliable, and efficient service is an appropriate model given the geographic
landscape of Lanao del Sur defined by the lake, mountain ridges, and the maritime coast. The transport
infrastructure shall be located strategically across the proposed geographic clusters. [Refer to Map 14]
(Refer to the section on transportation strategies for a detailed discussion).

Each functional geographic cluster shall be served by few consolidation infrastructures, as the first
echelon, to collect goods and transport raw materials and supplies from the production areas to meet a
specified competitive aggregate volume. The first stage of agricultural processing such as sorting, and
quality check can be embedded in the consolidation.
The second echelon entails transporting the consolidated volumes of raw materials to manufacturing or
agriculture processing facilities. A rail-based or a lake-based transport and logistics system can be viable
in bringing large volumes of raw materials and goods to processing centers.
While manufacturing is largely dominated by the private sector, public provision of a shared tap-up
processing facilities will be necessary as the province tries to elevate the culture of entrepreneurship from
just mere trading of imported goods (i.e. goods procured outside Lanao del Sur) to value-laden production
and trading. The goal of the province is to reach a critical mass of manufacturers to push the boundaries
of local production. The agriculture processing cluster in the coastal areas and in the Metropolitan Marawi
are suitable areas for manufacturing.
The third echelon comprises the transportation of goods from the local suppliers to transshipment
facilities (for goods to be exported to the rest of the country and the world) or to the local warehouse
including different types of storage facilities (for goods to be marketed locally or be part of inventories for
exports). The geographic position of the coastal area in the agriculture processing cluster makes it an
important logistic sub regional logistic hub that connects manufacturers and local suppliers to the
domestic and global economy.
The fourth echelon is the distribution of locally produced goods down the line to wholesale and retail
trade. The final echelon comprises the distribution of goods to final demand points in major markets
within and outside Lanao del Sur.
External shocks such as the Covid-19 global pandemic highlights the role of logistics in terms of securing
the availability of food and goods for the local residents and limiting the transmission of the disease
brought largely by increased movement of people. Innovations such as food convoy or rolling markets by
paying local farmers and manufacturers for their produce and then providing fresh and healthy produce
to the needy families will help to reduce the risk of exposing individuals to hunger. A dedicated mode of
transportation for goods and supporting and organizing a local group of logistic service providers including
public utility drivers to provide special delivery services of food and agricultural items to families in
disaster or crisis situations. Food banks, viewed as an inventory management and distribution in contract
logistics, is useful where local manufacturers or local farmers set a portion of their produce and stored in
food banks for distribution during crisis or to the poorest of households during normal times. A voucher
system and use of modern computing technology are tools available to ease management operation for
the distribution of goods from food banks.
The policy environment in Lanao del Sur needs to be cohesive to support the whole spectrum of logistics
networks identified earlier. Aside from infrastructures, the province shall invest in relationship
72

development across the supply chain with the help of third-party logistic service providers and acquire
the expertise in logistics management and operations. To be successful, it needs to utilize labor and
technical skills efficiently. Further, a data-driven demand forecasting and inventory management
including handling and warehousing policies will tremendously contribute to improving the reliability of
movement and transformation of raw materials into value-laden goods to reach the final consumers.
Designing and implementing a reliable system to trace the movement and transformation of goods will
help identify the cost efficiencies at the different stages of the supply chain.
6.4.4.3. Industrial Policy
Existing market and governance failures prevented the province to mount a robust agriculture-based
manufacturing sector, that has historically been confined to micro to small-scale food and artefact
production and dominated by a monopolist cassava starch producer. Except for very few products, Lanao
del Sur continues to thrive on import13 orientation of largely consumption goods which find their way to
the service sector, particularly trade. If the province is to achieve rapid and sustained economic growth
and improved household incomes, it needs to launch an outward-looking (i.e. export-oriented)
manufacturing (starting with agriculture-based processing) and move towards the development of an
export structure consisting of high value content products in the next 20 years. The goal is to develop
related products along the Halal-based value chain to optimize the use of factors of production (land,
labor, capital, skills and technology) and to build the scale and span as a strategy to break into the
domestic and global markets (refer to the discussion in the previous sections).
The deepening of the province’s manufacturing sector shall be driven by a strong industrial policy, along
with selective investments in skills, technology, and infrastructures. Because it will start developing its
capabilities in manufacturing that exhibit substantial quality improvements of related products, the
province shall explore the viability of encouraging selective foreign direct investments (FDIs) and providing
export incentives, credit allocation or subsidies, as well as technology support. A business arrangement
involving FDIs that allow partnerships with local entrepreneurs which are largely dominated by small and
medium enterprises (SMEs) will induce the latter to venture into production of higher-level goods with
high local content and to become future industrialists in their own right.
For a start, SMEs need support for an array of training and productivity development, startups, scienceindustry collaboration, technology, export promotion and marketing policies, and tax incentives, which
are critical for the development of the industrial structure in manufacturing. Setting up a specialized
finance platform using Islamic finance as its framework of operation, to be called Ranaw Small and
Medium Industries Financial Scheme, to help SMEs upgrade their equipment will greatly increase the
participation of SME in the industrialization efforts.

Strong and well-funded support institutions such as an export promotion agency, a fully equipped design
center, and technical institutes will address the constant yearning for quality improvement and product
development. The institutes are technology infrastructure with dedicated R&D centers related to
agriculture and marine science, plant system engineering, food science, packaging engineering and
material science, machineries and metallurgical engineering, transportation and telecommunication,
standards, renewables, etc. These are medium to large scale projects to be undertaken through a public
and private collaboration because R&D are inherently risky investments yet vital to the success of the
industrialization program of Lanao del Sur.
Industrialization efforts require the province to address the infrastructure gaps such as reliable power
supply, transportation and logistics network, potable water supply, communication, waste management,
among other things, favoring the side of green technologies.
The envisioned structural transformation will only be attainable if the industrial policy is complemented
by a strong human capital base as well as a political economy and macroeconomic environment that
provide a stable and predictable incentive framework for investment. This entails investing in institutional
and administrative capital and strengthening the local governments to design and implement a coherent
approach to mount policies that respond to the markets. The province LGU needs to continuously monitor
the granting of privileges to the private sector. It is crucial that awarding economic privileges must depend
on export performance of each firm-grantee. Otherwise, economic privileges and support will only distort
the market incentives that will result in a costly policy-induced market failure. A contest will be a viable
tool that has dual purpose: it tracks export performance, and it makes it certain that “the favors [given to
the private sector in the manufacturing sector] are returned [in the form of better export performance]”14
in Lanao del Sur.
The province shall also streamline administrative and regulatory policies to ease the process, and
ultimately reduce the economic cost of doing business. Establishing an Industrial Development Council is
necessary to strengthen local government capability to pursue an agriculture-based industrialization
program of the province. Also, setting up a Small and Medium Industries Bureau to provide a one-stop
consulting services on startup, finance, management, and technology needs, and to coordinate assistance
with other agencies or ministries will be a tremendous boost to SME development and promotion.
6.4.4.4. Tourism Policy
Tourism has a strategic importance to the economy of Lanao del Sur in the next 20 years, even though
tourism is currently on its infancy stage. There are so many aspects of Lanao del Sur’s character that
intrigue and attract visitors alike to come and discover the province. First, it is home to a colorful and bold
culture like a perched proud Sarimanok, and a local artistry with a town recognized as a UNESCO cultural
heritage. Hidden in the mountainous province are stunning and varied topographic and ecological

14

Lall, Sanjaya (2000)

74

landscapes, in their pristine forms, comparable to famous destinations in Asia and Europe. And, not only
that, the province is home to thousands of friendly, helpful, and entrepreneurial people with thick accents
and a deadpan sense of humor.
It is in this context that, in the years to come, protecting and enhancing the cultural and ecological heritage
will be important to ensure that residents and visitors will come to enjoy and marvel at the glory of Lanao
del Sur. Upskilling the labor force will be key to make every visit in Lanao del Sur truly memorable and to
attract investments because tourism will be embedded in the local economy. The idea is to create a
sustainable tourism sector whose central pillar is that it promotes the local culture and the ecology, it sells
products and services, it creates jobs, it generates value, and it attracts visitors year-round.
Lanao del Sur shall be nurtured as a pleasant place to live and work, which will help it gain the reputation
as a great place to visit. This entails respecting the natural landscape, building the essential
infrastructures, restoring and refurbishing historical sites and old buildings including the torogan and
langgal (traditional pagoda-like mosques), and providing pleasant public spaces, with authentic Mëranaw
character, and pedestrian flows.
The ever-changing consumer preferences require the need to connect far-flung areas in the province to
provide ample choices for visitors to spend their quality time. The possibility of combining life with nature
and in tranquil places will be a major attractor for memorable visits. About 35 current and potential
tourism sites, and more to be discovered, across Lanao del Sur have been identified. However, extending
the tourism footprint to ecologically fragile areas and rural neighborhoods shall be carefully managed to
align with the existing environmental plans and the specific needs of the local communities. The tourism
policy will benefit tremendously if the LGU is able to update and enforce its regulations on place
management. An integrated transport infrastructure solution that satisfies the criteria of safety,
timeliness, comfort, and affordability will ensure a seamless adventure for visitors and residents alike from
the arrival points at designated stations onward to visitor destinations. The role of technology, particularly
the internet-of-things, will provide a major boost to visitor convenience.
Various industries contribute to the value creation of tourism. The tourism industry will help enhance
Lanao del Sur’s position to be the most entrepreneurial province in the region. A wide array of micro and
small-scale enterprises shall be supported that employ sophisticated techniques of preservation and
packaging of artisanal merchandise, that conforms to global standards. Their products will not only
provide niche markets and jobs to locals but will also immerse tourists with an authentic Kasäka-sakaw a
Mëranaw to complete visitor experiences. Agriculture or food tourism is another hospitality experience
that the province LGU will develop in harmony with farming and natural pre-conditions. The same is true
for cultural tourism to marvel visitors with the exquisite taste of world-renown Mëranaw artistry and
craftsmanship, dances, musical traditions, as well as sports, alternative wellness, and the general ways of
life. (Refer to the strategies on culture such as the Darangën Path, cultural districts, and the Mëranaw
Culturepreneurship in later section)

Vision 2040

Lanao del Sur PDPFP

75

Lanao del Sur shall also nurture local residents, tourism service suppliers, and business operators.
Residents will be consulted on tourism development in their localities. They will be encouraged to
welcome, immerse, and enthrall visitors in local festivities, community events, and attractions. Local and
business leaders shall ensure that their operations and workforce are equipped to operate efficiently and
responsibly to run tourism services.
Adoption of a suitable tourism brand anchored on a sound communication plan will help disseminate all
that is exciting about Lanao del Sur as an enchanting visitor destination in the Philippine map. Even
students from the rest of the Philippines coming to study in Marawi City can help communicate the
Mëranaw tourism inspiration and hospitality experiences.
And, lastly, to be truly sustainable, the tourism industry shall adhere to the principles of a circular
economy. The goal is to make it possible for visitors to undertake the adventure or journey in Lanao del
Sur in an eco-sensitive manner from arrival to visitor destination. Accreditation of accommodation,
activities, and events must mean they have a clear environmental profile, that places particular
importance to the local culture and natural environment. Infrastructures for waste management shall be
placed in conspicuous areas. Further, the province shall encourage that visitor spending shall be retained
in the local economy, with products and services locally sourced. A tourism footprint in the Lanao del Sur
shall have zero ecological footprint.
6.4.4.5. Food and Nutrition Security Policy15
The ambition of Lanao del Sur is to achieve a sustainable food industry where hunger and malnutrition
shall not be detrimental to every individual in his/her pursuit of growth and happiness. Food security can
be realized through the adoption of a pan-community and localist approach to food production and food
consumption. Food security is a responsibility of the whole community, working in tandem with the LGU
and national agencies. It encompasses the varied sectors of the local economy from agriculture and
private enterprise to infrastructure, health, education, social welfare, governance, environment, peace
and security, disaster management.
Food and nutrition security shall be at the core of local governance in Lanao del Sur. The province has a
thriving agriculture and fishery culture and industry. Its land is highly fertile, its lakes and coasts replete
with diverse life forms. Food culture is embedded in both urban and rural lifestyles, so that pursuing the
goal of food and nutritional security to combat malnourishment and hunger is highly accessible through
a collaborative partnership of the communities, farmers, traders, retailers, academe, the local
government, and all other actors of the sustainable food system. The solution to the food security
challenge in Lanao del Sur depends on the responsible and thoughtful understanding of the supply chain,
access, and affordability of food and nutrition.

15

This is based on the recommendation of Assad Baunto to the City LGU of Isabela in Basilan when the latter
drafted its strategy plan in 2019.

76

Addressing the challenges to food and nutritional security in Lanao del Sur requires a deliberate effort on
increasing access to income generation opportunities, food availability, food utilization by households,
and safety nets. Education, culture and good governance all play a vital aspect of changing behavior and
committing to actions to reduce hunger and malnutrition. Quite often food security is seen under the
realm of crisis or disaster mode, but it should not be the case. Food security shall be reinstated at the core
of urban development planning even in the normal scenario (i.e. no crisis or disaster period) as it is for
sectoral approach concerning agriculture and fishery development given the rising trends of population
growth, urbanization, and a changed climate. As such, food security shall be tied to the long-term goals
of agricultural and fishery development.
The food and nutrition security policy in Lanao del Sur has several elements:
●

Access to food-based income earning opportunities. Food production shall optimize the use of
available spaces, subject to the province’s land use. A significant number of action plans are
identified in the earlier sections on Specialization, Local advantages, as well as Agricultural and
Rural Development Policy.

●

Trade, finance, and market structure. This covers credits or grants to farmers and local producers
and organizing regular farmers’ markets. Regulations and monitoring of prices and industry
behavior will help deter any untoward practices of strategic behaviors such as price manipulation,
regulatory capture, or hoarding (especially during a pandemic). This also covers regulation on food
safety and hygiene as well as conformance to halal standards. Support to organizing ultra-micro
producers such as turo-turo and local eateries to secure accreditation, to conform to minimal
standards, and to participate in community ratings will promote income generation to small
players while addressing cleanliness and nutrition value of local produce. Digital solutions to food
marketing such as online-based selling of local SMEs will expand the market reach of products
while being mindful of contact-less market interaction.

●

Secured food flow. A substantial number of strategies are indicated in the section on Logistics
Policy and Agricultural and Rural Development Policy. Aside from the usual routes of food storage
and transportation, local innovations such as organizing food convoys, establishing food banks in
strategic areas using raw materials from local farmers, and organizing and training a select
transport operators or providers exclusive for food delivery.

●

Food and education. Food production and gardening shall be revived as part of school curriculum
as early as primary or pre-school years. To be meaningful and effective in later years, there shall
be support to gender and food security so that food production shall not be a catalyst to the
traditional role of gender. All gender shall learn all aspects of the food system from cultivation
and to preparation, distribution and final consumption. The LGU shall explore establishing a seed
fund for innovative farming and food management. Support to community-operated
experimental farming and food preparation will help enliven the food culture in Lanao del Sur.

Vision 2040

Lanao del Sur PDPFP

77

●

Food and social safety nets. This refers to operationalization of a network of food banks and
providing a system of distribution such as food vouchers to the underserved households.
Establishing communal kitchens located in poor and densely populated areas will help curb
malnutrition and free up budgets of poor households to other important uses such as education
and health.

●

Food and culture. This refers to supporting food districts and identity food products, extensively
discussed in early sections. Reviving the food sharing gathering culture in iconic places such as the
practice in Banggolo during the month of Ramadhan in the 1980s helps to build the sense of
community, trust, and camaraderie.

●

Reduction of waste and losses. The province shall promote a circular economy because it not only
provides incomes to local producers but also reduces ecological foot print. Adoption of innovative
farming such as floating farms suitable for certain crops, is similar to aquaponic farming
ecosystem which helps maximize the use of water and nutrients compared to traditional irrigation
systems.

●

Food and governance. This covers the need to support the creation of a local body to be
responsible for the development of food and nutrition programs of Lanao del Sur. Revisiting LGU
land use plans, and drafting local bills, to allow urban agriculture zoning proposals in the current
land use codes to support food security. The province shall also adopt local fiscal measures to
encourage food productivity, which include (i) use its local taxing power to idle land, (ii) provide
incentives to put existing idle land to good use (e.g. farming), (iii) grant usufruct ownership to local
residents to transform abandoned or idle land including unused parking lots for food cultivation,
and (iv) encourage community-based farming of abandoned or idle land for a minimal annual rent.

6.4.5. Space and Peacebuilding: Shared Prosperity and Reducing Inequality
The cost of an unproductive and inequitable economy is the attractiveness of joining armed groups. At
the same time, escalation of violence can lead to low business confidence and, to the extreme, the
decimation of a city.
The factors which have an adverse effect on economic production in conflict situations are diverse. In
agriculture, insecurity due to conflict situations frequently leads to a reduction in the area of land planted,
as people either plant closer to the home for additional security or farther away from the main roads
because of the threat of insecurity. Conflict may also lead to the destruction of agricultural infrastructure
and the drastic reduction or untimely exit of extension advice and services. Reduced access or loss of
markets as a result of the conflict also limits access to inputs, while a reduction in production can limit the
use that can be made of markets. In pastoral or agri-pastoral populations armed conflict can have a
dramatic impact on livestock numbers and on access to food in the family. Animals may be killed, stolen
or succumb to disease due to the collapse of the veterinary services. The instability of an area discourages
tourists, businesses, and investors, and it undermines the long-term investment reputation and good will.
78

However, it must also be noted that the root causes of conflict are food insecurity, poverty, hunger and
inequalities. Poverty drove some Mëranaws to join armed groups. To achieve peace and stability, the
province is supporting the “From Arms to Farms” Program of the Department of Agriculture, fosters peace
through agriculture and fishery development. It was crafted to help war torn families and former rebels
to battle against hunger through farming. Their farms are used as the learning site or school for practical
agriculture. From rebels, they were transformed to returnees, to farmers, then to agriculture educators.
More than that and despite struggling to maintain positive peace, they eventually upscaled to become
“agri-preneurs” while their once-idle land was improved to become a farm tourism destination.
It is against this backdrop that Lanao del Sur views economic resurgence a necessary condition for peace
and stability in the next 20 years and beyond. Lanao del Sur is a shared space for every community and
family to earn productively, decently and equitably. After all, this shared and fertile space perched on the
mountain slopes of Lanao has been a place where each is allowed to partake its bounty and live a peaceful
coexistence, according to the traditions of Darangën.

6.5. Social Development
6.5.1. Overview of Issues and Strategies: Social Development
By 2040, the Province is known as a local government unit that promotes the rights of every constituent,
enabling them to realize their worth, dignity, and potential. On this, the Province will be known for having
substantially achieved SDG 3 (Healthy lives and well-being), SDG 4 (Quality education), SDG 5 (Gender
equality), SDG 6 (availability and sustainable management of water), SDG 11 (sustainable cities and
communities), and SDG 16 (peaceful and inclusive societies) for its diverse population as it recovers from
the disruption caused by COVID-19. The Province will build a community where citizens appreciate the
importance of upholding the common good, establishing rapport between and among families, and
encouraging community participation and empowerment. The Province gives importance to provide basic
education for the children.
To realize these goals, the following strategies are proposed. [Refer to Table 11] All these shall be
implemented in the context of COVID-19. This consists of five sub-categories namely: Service Delivery,
Regulation, Financing, Governance and Performance Accountability, all to be considered viz the impacts
of COVID-19.

6.5.2. Education as Engine of Growth and Peaceful Development
By 2040, Lanao del Sur will be known for ensuring implementation of inclusive and quality education to
all of its constituents, girls and women, boys and men, promoting lifelong opportunities for all. This shall
be implemented within the context of the impacts of COVID-19 has which has serious consequences on
efforts at ensuring equitable access to quality education that is not only disaster-risk resilient but also
culture-sensitive and honors the country's commitments to the SDGs. These require a shift in thinking of
availability and access from the conventional face-to-face mode of instruction to the necessities required
by safer learning spaces to manage impacts of COVID-19 and other disaster risks on the population of the
province. Schools had to close and remote learning is a serious challenge. In addition, lack of basic
sanitation facilities needs to be addressed since handwashing is important to preventing infection and
spread of COVID-19.
The Provincial Government will take a stronger leadership in terms of defining strategic, sustainable
directions for education as the guidance for determining medium-terms recovery actions in this sector.
This also requires clearly defining how each educational subsector (e.g., basic, non-formal, madrasah,
technical vocational) will contribute to the overall vision of the province and where higher investment is
to be made.

82

The rapid increase in population, densification and movement of people will have an impact on the
delivery of quality, relevant and appropriate education which can be equitably accessed by all. The
Provincial Government also ensure that education policies and programs support not just prosperity but
also lead towards increased citizen.

6.5.2.1. Education for Upward Mobility
By 2040, Lanao del Sur will be known for developing a highly productive and competent pool of talents
from its universities. Recognizing the value conferred on education by its constituencies, the Lanao del
Sur Government will implement strategies that support the advancement of students to productive
endeavors. It will align the educational thrusts with the economic priorities as well as cultural preservation
and social development aspirations of the Province and its people.
Specialized schools in the cultural arts, agriculture, urban and transportation management, business
management and entrepreneurship, science and technology including food technology and packaging
engineering, metallurgical engineering and ICT and other fields with strategic importance to the province
will provide human capital advantage to support critical industries in the next 20 years and beyond.
Creating a higher education in vocational courses (i.e. past the vocational and technical course within the
K-12) will be an opportunity for deeper levels of specialization, subject to the requirements of the Ministry
of Basic Education, Higher Education, and Technical Education (MBHTE). The private sector and the LGU
are in the best position to open schools for vocational and technical courses and apprenticeship programs.
Because COVID-19 created challenges to education delivery, the Province will support measures to adapt
to the impacts of the pandemic through technological advancements, blended learning and courses that
will develop local capacities to deal with complex emergencies and rapid changes both globally and locally.
Young people and adults will be able to find good employment or become entrepreneurs as a result of
quality education.
6.5.2.2. Education for Peace
By 2040, Lanao del Sur will be known as having developed a strong peace culture among its citizens
through education. The province being a place vulnerable to armed conflicts, education is recognized as
a valuable tool to build peace among young people and across generations. The Provincial Government
will support the development of curriculum for formal and non-formal education that integrates peace
concepts and practice, building on cultural assets that foster mutual understanding and harmony. It will
also address gender disparities in education and integrate disaster-risk resilience and peace promotion in
the curriculum.

6.5.3. Health, WaSH, and Social Sector
By 2040, the Province will have provided access to safe and affordable public health facilities and drinking
water, sanitation and hygiene for all, pivoted towards the impacts of COVID-19. In water facilities, it will
also look into substantially reducing water pollution and dumping of hazardous waste while managing and
protecting water-related natural systems. This universal and direct access to water and water-related
services will be designed through an ecosystem and spatial approach.

Vision 2040

Lanao del Sur PDPFP

85

Demographic changes in addition to past and emerging health challenges will impact on the delivery of
public health systems. As with education delivery, health facilities and services planning must also take
the impacts of COVID-19 into consideration while being mindful of commitments to SDG3 (healthy lives
and well-being). Spatial planning is an essential tool as well, in rationalizing location of services and
facilities with consideration of multiple factors such as national standards, population, environmental
protection, to name some.

6.5.4. Housing
By 2040, Lanao del Sur will have provided safe and affordable housing in settlements designed according
to the principles of environmental soundness, spatial rationality, land rights, cultural values, stability and
recognition of diverse needs of its homeless populations, e.g. people with disability, aged,
ethnicity. These settlements will be designed as self-reliant communities whereby it can develop its local
economy, social advancement and management of its environment consistent with regional and national
laws. Prioritized for housing are persons, families and households displaced by the 2017 Marawi siege
who continue to languish in transitory sites and evacuation centers.

6.5.5. Social Services and Social Protection
By 2040, the Provincial Government has provided responsive and adequate social welfare and social
protection services to these diverse populations within its resources and resource mobilization capacities
while respecting the dignity of each person in the delivery of these services. recognizes the need to
address diverse social welfare needs of its diverse populations in terms of age, gender, income class,
ethnicity, disability, location, among others. All these are in pursuit of the key principle in the SDGs of
leaving no one behind by reaching the furthest behind first.

6.6. Infrastructure
6.6.1. Overview of Issues and Strategies: Infrastructure
By 2040, the Provincial Government of Lanao del Sur aims to provide resilient, sustainable, adequate,
modern and reliable infrastructure that shall enhance quality of life, the natural environment, and
economic activity of the community.
This is consistent with global, national, and regional guidance on infrastructure development, which
recognizes that modern and sustainable economic infrastructure is required for economic growth.
Guidance in this section is aimed at ensuring that Lanao del Sur’s citizens can connect with a range of
facilities and services, get to their places of work, study, worship, and leisure, and businesses are
supported by efficient and robust connections for goods and services, including electricity and
telecommunications.
These aims are underpinned by a commitment to environmentally sustainable infrastructure, which will
complement the policies discussed in section 6.3 on the Environment and Disaster Risk Reduction and
management. These economically connective infrastructure also complements the strategies related to
social development infrastructure (school buildings, health centers, water and sanitation, and other
priority community facilities, as well as housing), including those earmarked for post-Marawi crisis
rehabilitation and reconstruction. The distribution and design of these investments should address the
urban/rural divide, in line with the goal of strengthening community cohesion through integrated services
and facilities, fostering a stronger community spirit and sense of place, and conserving and enhancing the
built and environmental heritage of Lanao del Sur.
To realize these desired infrastructure development outcomes, the Provincial Government of Lanao del
Sur, in partnership with relevant stakeholders, will invest in the following strategic initiatives: [Refer to

Apart from the provision of basic infrastructure, which is still lacking in Lanao del Sur, envisioned ‘gamechanger’ initiatives for the sector include investments in renewable energy, enhancements in
telecommunications, and low-carbon intermodal and integrated public transportation. Decision makers
will have to balance economic growth and environmental impacts on air and water quality and potential
deforestation and soil erosion, particularly given the protected area status of the Lake Lanao watershed.
To do so, local governments must Identify key assets and areas that are at risk through climate change,
protect soils, and protect and extend the ecosystems and habitats that can reduce or buffer the effects of
extreme climate events. At the same time, local governments must work to secure an adequate supply of
suitable land for these investments, which should avoid areas at risk of flooding or landslides while
avoiding the usual issues related to securing road right of way permissions.

6.6.2. Promoting and Expanding Comfortable, Friendly, and Efficient Public Transport
In order to achieve Lanao del Sur’s goals for economic competitiveness while ensuring social inclusion, it
is important to promote transportation which balances the needs of the environment, society, and
economy.

90

Given the very low road density in the area, investment must be made to Improve transport connectivity
and increase mobility opportunities for people living in geographically isolated and hard-to-reach-areas
To do so, the province commits to Construct quality roads and bridges and improve existing roads and
bridges for additional road capacity and to connect the missing links of important roads. This will facilitate
the full implementation of the Provincial Spatial Strategy by improving accessibility to towns and helps to
build an integrated regional economy, facilitates tourist travel including improving connections to key
tourism sites and reduces where possible, unsuitable traffic into towns. [Refer to Map 16 and Map 17]
The present transportation system is presently stacked in the favor of people who own their own vehicles,
with limited trips across the province. With the view that no one should be left behind, increased mobility
is not only an economic function but an investment in peace.
Promoting and expanding a comfortable, friendly, and efficient public transport system with Lanao del
Sur begins with preparation of a Local Public Transport Route Plan (LPRTRP) for the province. Guided by
this plan, physical investments will include the construction of municipal public transport terminals,
upgrading of existing inland waterway transport infrastructures, and Improve different procedures
covering legal, technical, safety and market requirements needed in rendering transportation services on
airways and waterways.
The Malabang Airport in the municipality of Malabang, classified as a Community Airport, is dilapidated
and non-operational, forcing Lanao del Sur residents to travel either via Laguindingan Airport in Misamis
Oriental or Awang Airport in Datu Odin Sinsuat, Maguindanao. Feasibility studies for rehabilitating
Malabang Airport will be prepared particularly with the envisioned future increase in freight transport
requirements.
The community lake-based shipping industry shall be revived to improve movements of goods and people
within the province. Setting up one port with regular medium-sized boats per functional cluster will boost
inter-municipal trade.
For the provincial urban and peri-urban centers such as Metropolitan Marawi, an efficient transport
system will allow people and goods to move quickly around these areas and to commute to and from it.
Improving traffic management particularly for Metro Marawi is a priority. To address issues on road
transportation sector by holding convergence conferences with LTFRB and LTO to identify gaps and
resolve the intertwined issues on issuance of public transportation franchises and other traffic
management issues.
A zero-accident regime in Lanao del Sur will be implemented by pushing for discipline and safety in the
transport sector through road safety literacy. Educate the people on traffic rules and regulations by
collaborating with the transportation sectors in implementing the mandatory road- safety curriculum in
PH schools (Senate Bill No. 1231) and strictly requiring all drivers ‘ license applicants and existing licensed

drivers to undergo a mandatory driving seminar and actual driving test before granting full driving
privilege. (House Bill 505 or the proposed ‘Roadworthy Driving Seminar for All Drivers Act)
Incentives will also be put in place to encourage Lanao del Sur residents to use more energy efficient forms
of transport such as a no Parking-No Car Policy, strengthening public transportation options, and
redesigning streets to popularize non-motorized modalities such as cycling.

6.6.3. Implementing Environmentally Sustainable Infrastructure
The Province will promote a strategic and sustainable approach to the provision of infrastructure, in a
manner that is climate-resilient and minimizes environmental impact.
Consistent with the principles described in the Environment Strategy above, water and sewerage services
and flood risk management will cover both hard and soft approaches, not only relying on concreted flood
control projects but also maximizing the existing features of the area for natural drainage and water
absorption. Sustainable drainage systems will be used as an alternative and/or complement to the
conventional drainage systems approach to address long-term sustainability.
To meet the unfulfilled potential of Lanao del Sur’s tourism industry, environmentally sustainable tourism
development shall be encouraged, along with investments in peace and security and other related
aspects. Development of tourism infrastructure needs to be appropriate to the location to ensure that
the natural assets are protected and enhanced, alongside multi-stakeholder investments in access,
accommodation and visitor facilities (see the Economic Development strategy).

6.6.4. Supporting Energization
Despite being the source of much of Mindanao’s energy, Lanao del Sur is burdened by a power supply
shortage that is exacerbated by outdated distribution facilities, high distribution loss rate, and low
electrification at the sitio level.
The Agus 1 and 2 hydroelectric power plants in Marawi and Saguiaran have a total installed capacity of
260 MW distributed across the Mindanao grid.
As of 2018, LASURECO covers 1175 barangays out of 41 municipalities/cities but is only able to cover
roughly 50 percent of sitios (68 sitios out of 136 potential sites for energization) while serving only 36
percent connections served out of 156,000 potential connections.
To serve the needs of Lanao del Sur’s citizens, the goal is to Integrate all electrification initiatives and
efforts in order to achieve 100 percent barangay electrification and households by 2040. In partnership
with prospective investors and developers, Lanao del Sur shall pursue the entry of new and emerging
technologies for cost-effective power generation and increase the contribution that renewable energy
can make to the overall energy mix. This will support the Philippine Energy Plan for 2012-2030, which
directs the country in creating a future with less carbon and making energy efficiency a way of life through
the use of alternative fuels and renewable energy as intelligent choices.
To facilitate this, the Province shall engage partnerships to conduct policy studies on optimal energy mix
(e.g. micro-hydro systems, wind energy and solar energy) for off-grid areas, and strengthen institutional
cooperation with DOE, NEA, NPC and NGCP to ensure transparent and effective DDP. Expand services and
improve operations of LASURECO to strengthen the grid and increase efficiency and reduction of losses
Vision 2040

|

Lanao del Sur PDPFP

95

Once the basic needs of households are met, the province shall determine new areas for electrification as
well as eco-zones for private investment purposes.

6.6.5. Connecting Metropolitan Marawi and Clusters of Municipalities to the Digital Network
Access to information in Lanao del Sur is circumscribed by the lack of communication infrastructures.
The province LGU shall engage the private sector (Globe, PLDT, and SMART) and donor community to
accelerate access of communities to communication by setting up cell site towers and infrastructures for
high broadband speeds such as fiber optics across the province. Each functional cluster of the province
must have few cell towers to provide an evenly distributed digital backbone to the communities and to
encourage production and trade in the future. At the same, scaling up of People Konek will boost the
digital access of communities in far-flung areas.
Improving the infrastructures is essential for the proposed Command Center of the LGU to allow law
enforcers and front line workers respond to communities affected by disasters efficiently.
The use of popular forms of information sharing at community level (ex. two way radios) especially for
emergency situations is invaluable and must be supported.
The LGUs and the private sector shall strengthen role of mass media in information dissemination of
opportunities, in expanding consumer choices, in educating voters during election, in initiating mass
literacy, and in combating corruption, violence, and inequality in the province. There are very few mass
media outfits (mainly radio broadcast) in Lanao del Sur, but some of them folded up in the past because
of harassments or threats that some of them had received. The province shall support to securing legal
registration of PDRRMC Radio Communication with the help of the National Telecommunications
Commission.

6.7. Culture
6.7.1. Overview of Issues and Strategies: Culture and Development
Despite the rich cultural heritage of the Mëranaws, some elements of the indigenous traditions have
faded due to the massive pressures of global influence—both Westernization and Arabization. Calls for
cultural revivalism have never been in the development and physical agenda in recent years, apart from
selecting only what is generally regarded as “neutral” to the strict Islamic traditions (i.e. no element of
animism or depiction of living forms). But even then, culture has been relegated as an afterthought, a
given, a field that is confined to the bucolic setting, or something that must be preserved and not
celebrated in contemporary economy. A little more than one generation has passed when the kind of
Islam fully embraced by the locals was more tolerant to the traditional practices such as calling the wisdom
of the ancient through bäyok, merrymaking in community festivities of kalilang, storytelling of folklore
told by the old to the young, and a lot more. The present and future generations of Mëranaws desire to
change that mindset. Lanao del Sur will leverage all aspects of the indigenous Mëranaw culture, and,
perhaps, modify their use, while maintaining their primary characteristics, suited to the needs of the
society and contemporary economy. In terms of physical planning, these traditions shall be translated in
urban forms as a way of rediscovering the cultural, social, and economic identities of the Mëranaws, which
will serve as the Lanao del Sur's new sustainable model of development.
Lanao del Sur is committed to its long-standing cultural traditions and will take this further by embedding
them in all aspects of the productive sectors to create an encompassing creative industry. By 2040, the
province will evolve as an attractive location where its businesses, agriculture, tourism, public and
residential spaces, and infrastructure are imbued with its cultural traditions. Its residents will celebrate
their indigenous culture and will proudly promote the creative talents and cultural wealth.

6.7.2. Culture as Catalyst of Business, Tourism, and Economic Growth
Embedding the Mëranaw cultural heritage in Lanao del Sur’s economic activities will offer tremendous
opportunities. Developing a cultural urban landscape within the proposed Metropolitan Marawi that
combines the heritage, economy, and urban living will not only increase the attractiveness of the growth
area but also serve as a beacon of the truest sense of community living. The image of residents trading
their craft and enthralling visitors of the local customs, festivities, and art amidst an urban landscape
adorned on all sides with masterfully crafted okir and with modern and tidy cafes, shops, open public
spaces for performance art or exhibits, and traditional houses will come to mind. Such cultural urban
landscape will probably rival other beautiful places in southeast Asia.
The investments required will be immense, and it is necessary for the private sector and the communities
to be involved in such undertaking. Once the province is able to identify which section of the metropolitan
area the cultural landscape will emerge and what type of a carefully designed urban architectural work
will be adopted, the LGU can regulate building constructions and provide incentives to homeowners or
business owners to incorporate indigenous Mëranaw designs in their houses and facades. Similarly,
investment priority will be given to business lines that offer products or services with high value creation
(see previous discussion in the Economic Growth Strategies section) and with high cultural content.
The proposed cultural urban landscape will parallel the rural town of Tugaya which is recognized as a
cultural heritage site of Mëranaw craftsmanship. It will not compete with Tugaya but in fact will serve to
support and be part of a network of cultural districts (refer to the next section) across Lanao del Sur each
with its own distinct character. The proposed cultural urban landscape in Metro Marawi will serve as its
core or apex combining the traditional heritage and modern functionality to suit the contemporary
economy.

100

While the cultural districts will have their own distinct features, the province must adopt a cohesive motif
using the traditional creative element like the okir or sarimanok and apply the design universally to all
urban forms—from big infrastructures like buildings all the way to the smallest facilities such as street
name signposts or light posts. The initiative will be known as Okiran Tano. Of course, these indigenous
designs will stand out if the LGU will have to complement the initiative with regulations and strict
enforcement of banning the unnecessary use of public space including conspicuous areas along public
roads for commercial advertisements and streamers. The goals are to make the traditional elements of
Mëranaw art ubiquitous and establish the urban character of the Metropolitan Marawi and other areas
and to replace the chaotic image of the province donned by ugly streamers, commercial advertisements,
and Middle eastern or Western accent. The initiative will also create jobs for the cultural workers.
The province recognizes the importance of restoring historical sites and buildings of cultural and artistic
importance such as the torogan and langgal (or the pagoda-like mosques), if there are still any left,
because they are an expression of aspirations and ideals of the Mëranaws. While maintaining the primary
characteristics of these structures, refurbishing and converting them for functional use (such as café,
shared working area, or place of art exhibit) is an option. The goal is to have these cultural and historical
sites to be part of iconic urban architecture. At the same time, they become a venue where residents and
visitors will be able to experience a certain level of nostalgia in a modern setting.
Lanao del Sur will establish a first of its kind cultural tourism trail called the Darangën Path, as a process
of rediscovering the cultural identity of the Mëranaw, translated in urban forms and architecture. The
locals trace their history to the adventures of the characters of the Darangën—an epic lore of unparalleled
length from which the Mëranaw culture, the arts, traditional governance, folkways, social customs, and
mores emerged. And, yet not many among the young generation are versed about their oral literary
heritage because it is not accessible and very few understand the classical language upon which the
Darangën was mouthed. It is feared that, as the world becomes more connected in the digital age, the
pressures of Westernization and Arabization will completely erase from the memories of the future
generations the cultural triumphs of the indigenous Mëranaw traditions embodied in the epic. Hence, for
the first time, the LGU will identify and trace the places of interest and adventures across the province
that are mentioned in the Darangën starting from the birthplace of the Mëranaw culture in the
municipality of Bumbaran. The LGU will erect landmarks as well as cultural and functional amenities in
selected areas across Lanao del Sur that will capture each important canto or event signifying the myriad
adventures of the fabled characters. Cultural performances, festivities, traditional sports, and even the
everyday food culture shared and traded will be organized around the nodes of the Darangën Path. The
transport infrastructure will surely help in making these places accessible to both residents and visitors.
Lanao del Sur will start a movement that centers around culture and innovation in arts that operate within
the context of entrepreneurship. Culture and trade are closely linked in the Mëranaw society. It is just
fitting to claim that entrepreneurial thinking is a decisive factor for the success not only of cultural tourism
but the general business environment. The Mëranaw Culturepreneurship initiative will be a suitable
platform to promote culture, art and innovation as a vital economic practice. The goal is to leverage the
indigenous traditions to promote the identity, to add value and premium to products and services, to
Vision 2040

|

Lanao del Sur PDPFP

101

nurture the micro or small business structure (typically done by households) of the creative industry, to
have a cohesive value proposition of the creative sector in addressing the needs of any local businesses—
be it in terms of producing entirely unique products or services with indigenous elements or
characteristics, artistic and practical packaging, etc. The idea is to use culture as the lynchpin of innovative
forms of production.
Like any other products, cultural products, once they are traded and commercialized in the market, are at
risk of losing their quality. The LGU or an association or chamber of cultural product producers will have
to decide how to protect the quality, reputation, and authenticity of commodities. The Mëranaw Cultural
Product Indications will constitute a set of standards to ensure that products such as indigenous food
items, handwoven textiles, or other Mëranaw cultural artefacts employ traditional materials or
ingredients, traditional methods, and are produced only in the municipality they are traditionally known
for. The protected status of select cultural products adds premium to the local artisans, protects the
unsuspecting consumers to get the authentic and quality products, and builds market niches in the sea of
commercialized cultural products. The Mëranaw Cultural Product Indications shall be established by a
highly qualified group consisting of Mëranaw culture experts, culture bearers, anthropologists, clothing
and textile experts, food technologists, among others.

6.7.3. Community Engagement and the Creative Sector
The success of the creative sector lies with the local communities who themselves safeguard the local
cultural traditions and shape their evolution. While the Mëranaw cultural heritage are shared by all, few
towns are identifiable to have developed the advantage of nurturing and shaping some elements of the
heritage and, by circumstance or sheer diligence, have become ingrained in their community psyche more
than the others.
The municipality of Tugaya is famous for its ornate wood carving, brassware making, and weaving
industries. Tugaya, Marantao, and Bubong are well known for their elaborate mamandiang. The
municipalities of Malabang, Masiu, and Taraka are highly regarded for their culinary traditions, as are the
municipalities of Madamba, Madalum, and Balindong (Watu) for their sakurab. Maguing boasts its sësëd
or dëmpas production. Ganassi is recognized for its craftmanship in the production of awang (boats). The
LGU has yet to identify the cultural districts associated with indigenous sports. All across Ranaw, one finds
being enchanted by the melodious chants of the pabäbäyok often interrupted by a sonorous approbation
of the eager crowd, but there are particular towns in the province that have kept that tradition.
The province LGU will, hence, work with these communities to foster a strong sense of dignity as keeper
and propagator of the Mëranaw cultural asset. It will work in partnership with the private sector, with
priority of those coming from the area, and transform these communities into cultural districts with
attractive and functional amenities.
Apart from community engagement, the LGU shall bring together diverse areas of interests and inquiry in
the traditional arts, culture and modern fields such as information, communication and technology or ICT,
102

engineering, food and clothing technology, etc. The collaborative platform to be called Mëranaw Art and
Innovation Lab will be instrumental in this endeavor to advance the creative sector in the digital age and
modern economy.

6.7.4. Culture for the Future Generations
The province is committed to the objectives of increasing access to and participation in cultural arts of the
present and future generations and utilizing them to strengthen community identity. Investments in
culture and arts education programs will play a big role in achieving the objectives. One, establishing the
School of the Living Culture and Arts will be a tremendous boost to the research on tangible and intangible
cultural wealth. Second, including the study of Darangën as a mandatory curriculum requirement in basic
education in Lanao del Sur is a viable strategy to encourage appreciation of pupils at an early age on the
local oral tradition. And third, a thorough research study to establish the orthography of the Mëranaws is
essential to allow translation of the largely oral tradition as an expression of culture to written forms.
Apart from education and public information drive, the province can turn to other progressive strategies
to promote cultural art at the neighborhood level by, for example, organizing cultural events and artistic
activities. The use of vacant spaces and open lots as places for cultural visual art exhibit or performative
art shows will gain more audience from the masses, dispelling the notion that art is only for the educated
or economic elite. The possibility of transforming the MSU Aga Khan Museum into a community art center
will provide better use of space for interaction.
Once all the strategies above are implemented, efforts to declare the whole of the province as a heritage
site will not only greatly improve the image of Lanao del Sur but also it will hasten preservation of local
traditions, customs, and culture.
While it is essential to highlight that the Mëranaw cultural heritage is an articulation of the complex
relationship between the territory and the present generation and those who came before them, Lanao
del Sur has reason to recognize the diversity of some neighborhoods. After all, what makes an urban place
attractive and a great place to live and visit is the plurality of cultural expressions and the tolerance of
people behind them.

6.8.1. Overview of Issues and Strategies: Governance
The province is aware that working towards the long-term physical and economic transformation and
development will not immediately pave the way for social balance and stability. Competition for resources
and economic space, rapid urbanization, and dynamic population will, at least in the next 10 to 15 years,
create an environment of conflicting interests. The local government units of Lanao del Sur and its
component city and municipalities will take on a responsive approach to local governance that is for the
people. Quality of life of present and future generations will be the ultimate anchor of local governance
in Lanao del Sur, upon which future decisions, frameworks, and collective solutions emanate.
By 2040, the province and its municipalities will demonstrate financial sustainability, quality public service,
and zero corruption bureaucracy. These are essential to ensure the integrity of the public sector.
The demand for accelerated decision making, given the maximum number of interests and stakes in Lanao
del Sur, that will accompany future efforts on economic revitalization and quality urbanization require
people participation and broad-based consensus building.

6.8.2. Barometers of Good Governance
Lanao del Sur will strive to encourage at least 85 percent, if not all, of 41 LGUs including itself to meet and
practice all the metrical requirements for good governance by the DILG. These include: the Seal of Good
Local Governance (SGLG), Good Financial Housekeeping, Peace and Order audit, Provincial Anti-Drug
Abuse Council audit and its counterpart at the municipal level (PADAC and MADAC), and Child-Friendly
Local Governance Audit (CFLGA). These are initial steps LGUs can strive to achieve, to benefit from
expected efficiency and therefore good performance in the context of decentralization and whatever
incentives the BARMM can independently offer. The established metrics on good governance will be
matched with measures on quality of life to ascertain whether innovations in local governance has
ultimately produced the desired governance dividends or quality. To this end, the province will take a
proactive role in exercising its supervisory function to the city and all 39 municipalities.
At the same time, Provincial Government has to reinvent itself to be able to perform its regular functions
efficiently as it shifts its governance framework, systems and procedures to be able to address the
differential impacts of COVID-19, armed violence such as the Marawi siege and other disasters while
strategically working towards the achievement of the localized SDGs.
In addressing its regular functions, the Provincial Government can develop approaches on full disclosure,
for instance, for adoption by all municipal and barangay LGUs to deter corruption in the supply chain,
especially for cases involving delivery of any humanitarian assistance or productivity boost package
through voucher or direct exchange at the neighborhood or household level. It can strictly implement
measures to democratize information (i.e. strips away the monopoly over information by the middle
persons) and endows the beneficiaries the bargaining power to procure the assistance package based on
the price or cost promised by the government—national or local.

6.8.3. Quality Public Service for the Private Sector
The province will provide an enabling environment for the private sector including entrepreneurs and
innovators through good governance and quality public administration. This is important given the
immense challenges faced by the Provincial Government, and the entire country, as well all the entire
world. Thus, the first agenda for the Provincial Government is to gather as many stakeholders from the
private sector, preferably through their associations, to discuss collaboration for the recovery of the
Province informed by its strategic directions of progress, peace, resilience in the face of recent and future
challenges.
To ensure efficiency in government functions and encourage the involvement of the private sector, the
Provincial Government will ensure reforms take place to make their functions customer-friendly. This will
involve cutting the red tape and improving administrative procedures and requirements will be among
the first agenda to support business enterprise development in the province. Cumbersome bureaucratic
procedures lodged at different offices that come with too many fragmented fees (business permit,
microbusiness certification, SEC tax registration, fire and sanitary permits, environmental clearance,
108

license to operate and other BFAD requirements, Mayor’s permit, Halal certification, intellectual property
registration, social security, etc.) are barriers to entry among potential investors. Many entrepreneurs and
traders in Lanao del Sur opt to remain in the informal sector because a hefty volume of paperwork and
administrative fees serve as friction costs to formalizing businesses. Hence, a one-stop-shop will be set
up encompassing a phalanx of registrations, permits, and clearances complemented by a unified payment
systems to ease the cost of doing business.
The province recognizes the significant role of innovators and entrepreneurs wishing to invest in value
creating processes, technologies, or products in strategic sectors particularly to pivot the province postCOVID-19. They will be given local tax credits and incentives, and subsidies to enliven and foster the raw
entrepreneurial spirit inherent in the communities. In addition to focusing on initiatives that will deal with
the impacts of the pandemic, such as digital technology, mobile learning platforms. and renewable
energy, the province will focus on the following strategic areas: modern and sustainable agriculture
including agri-based manufacturing, light industries, transportation and logistics, telecommunications,
water systems, sanitation, financial services, cultural and green tourism, as well as Halal industry. In
addition, a provincial and municipal counselling program that prescribes legal, financial, and labor
information will be set up for new and established businesses. Support to startup capital for
entrepreneurs willing to invest and scale up innovations in products and services, or new lines of
businesses, that feature authentic Mëranaw goods, design, or processes to global standards.
Critical infrastructure with public good content (e.g. transportation, solid waste management) or that
concerns the “commons” (e.g. renewables and water distribution) may be provided by the public sector
through a quasi-public corporation or enterprise subject to the limits of the Local Government Code and
jurisprudence governing Government-Owned and Controlled Corporations (GOCCs). This schema,
however, has a risk of crowding out the private sector. Hence, a framework with sufficient room of
flexibility for private initiatives, including a review of public-private partnership arrangements and
financing options, is necessary. The abiding principles on private-public partnerships or quasi-public
endeavors are conditioned on maximum profitability for both the province LGUs and private sector (not
necessarily joint sharing of costs) and, above all, maximum social benefits to the local communities and
Lanao del Sur society.

6.8.4. People’s Participation in Local Governance
The province LGU will continue to coordinate with all stakeholders keeping with the principles of
participatory governance, accountability, transparency and responsiveness to ensure shared
understanding and cooperation the Provincial Government's pivot as a result of the pandemic. It will
continue involving the public as a partner in decision making and as a valuable source of field information.
To date, the province LGU convenes 29 special bodies, councils, and committees with the active
participation of civil society organizations (CSOs). Access to information (feedback and feed forward) need
to be in place in the digital space and through conventional methods. The LGU’s official website will
include a webpage or portal dedicated to public sector finances and procurement.
Vision 2040

109

Community engagement will be as a new focus area of public service for Lanao del Sur. The province will
revisit or draft protocols and policies on community engagement on social media, open data, videos,
regular newsletter, and local media. Democratic forms of discussion and decision making will be
developed in keeping faith with the tradition of kapämagayonayon, a consensus building tradition of
Mëranaw in a lama during the olden days and suited to the modern times. Kapehan sa Ranaw, Sorbetes
ko Kalumbayan, Pagana ko manga Innovators, etc. are examples of innovative approaches to community
engagement. These are avenues where the LGUs and the community can share experiences, draw out
successes, inform decisions about particular challenges and concerns needing immediate response from
both the public and private sector, and build consensus on recourse for future action. Members of the
community need a collective voice about how they see fit and live in a given economic, social, or physical
space. Establishing a Community Participation Fund may yet help future needs of people’s organizations
or civil service society pursue

6.8.5. Public Service Delivery and Public Satisfaction
The ultimate test of good governance is the delivery of quality services to each according to the needs of
the communities in a timely manner. The province will follow a convergence approach to service delivery
involving various agencies, offices, and functional units of the province and municipal or city LGUs for
optimum impact in targeted areas. This means that various government services and complementary
programs are invested in a community with the ultimate aim of improving the economic lot and building
social trust among residents. This approach is cogent and can be carried out by phase across Lanao del
Sur. Social projects have higher value for money if they are complemented by business and livelihood, and
infrastructure projects.
In addition, the convergence approach entails adopting an inter-disciplinary framework from planning to
implementation of programs and projects. The practice of collaborating with other disciplines cultivates
a culture of manifold innovations and creativity or is called by necessity. For instance, culture must always
figure in all social, economic, and infrastructure programs both: (1) to showcase the identity of Mëranaw
through design or as product or service, (2) to apply safeguard measures pertaining to land use and
ancestral domain of the Mëranaw or the rights of the non-Mëranaw minorities, and (3) to ensure that
formal and institutional structures do not crowd out the informal and traditional arrangements. For
instance, home for the aged is frowned upon by the cultural and Islamic teachings on love and care for
the elderly. Urban forms such as streetscape (streetlights, road signage, public benches), bridges, social
housing, business establishments, public buildings that incorporate an architectural okir design based on
the standards approved by the province LGU will be a sure bet to creating an authentic and unique cultural
hub in the Philippines. Environment, peace and order, and risk mitigation must be embedded in all
development assistance, as must gender and PWD sensitivity. The aim of convergence is to prevent the
prevailing sentiment that a mono-dimensional approach to service delivery thins out economic and social
net benefits.
The role of local governance in securing the availability of food and nutrition for the local residents is an
utmost priority. A local body will be created tasked to develop food and nutrition programs of Lanao del
110

Sur. The LGUs will need to revisit their land use plans, and draft local bills accordingly, to allow urban
agriculture zoning proposals in the current land use codes to support food security. The province shall
also adopt local fiscal measures to encourage food productivity, which include (i) use its local taxing power
to idle land, (ii) provide incentives to put existing idle land to good use (e.g. farming), (iii) grant usufruct
ownership to local residents to transform abandoned or idle land for food cultivation, and (iv) encourage
community-based farming of abandoned or idle land for a minimal annual rent. Some of the detailed
aspects of food security governing other sectors are discussed in the previous section under the economic
strategy.
The province will evaluate any completed public service or assistance delivered along the criteria of value
of money—efficiency, effectiveness, and results orientation. Projects with the greatest social, economic,
and environmental benefits relative to cost will be considered for scaling up or replication. Lessons
learned documented. Project administration must consistently and regularly undertake target beneficiary
review to provide no room for “ghosts”.
A province-wide registration and issuance of ID for residents and visitors, subject to the implementation
of the national ID system, will be the first-best option available to the LGU to better identify, track, and
monitor recipients of any direct assistance (health, social services, housing, business and livelihood,
education, etc.). An automated and encrypted database infrastructure subject to the provisions of data
privacy will significantly improve service delivery based on responsiveness principle of local governance.
The Provincial Government will require regular feedback from its citizens to be able to immediately act
on matters, particularly issues that will weigh heavily on the population. This will entail an organizational
shift encompassing work ethics and organizational values that uphold timely and responsive public
service. LGUs will dedicate a unit to receive, organize, process, and send feedbacks on specific issues on
the effects of its work addressing COVID-19 and other disasters, local governance and public
administration to responsible offices to address or rectify problems. The Citizen Accountability Forum is
an avenue for the province, municipal, and city LGUs to demand information and accountability.
Customer satisfaction will be embedded in all offices and units, particularly those involved in frontline
services (health, education, tourism, environment, trade and industry, civil registry, tax administration,
humanitarian services, social services) to gauge any room for improvement in future delivery of public
service. The province will roll out an annual in-depth satisfaction and expectations surveys (Ranaw
Household Satisfaction Survey, Ranaw Business Satisfaction Survey, Ranaw Household Expectation
Survey, and Ranaw Business Expectations Survey) to gauge the business and consumer sentiments about
the local economy. This entails organizing a dedicated quasi-public unit or center called Ranaw Sentiment
Barometer Center, with an interagency function, tasked to implement the survey, process the data
collected, coordinate with various government offices and instrumentalities to manage public sentiments.
In addition, the official websites of each LGU in Lanao del Sur will include a webpage on citizen satisfaction
to track concerns on a daily basis.

Ultimately, public satisfaction heavily relies on the quality of public administration and the delivery of
public services to the right people or constituency and on a timely basis.

6.8.6. Financial Management and Sustainability
Financial sustainability is important to the local government units of Lanao del Sur and the municipalities
and city that comprise it to fund quality public services and administration. Such can be achieved if there
is a good balance between internally generated income and external funds. LGUs that generate more
locally sourced income generally fare better in the provision of basic needs to its constituents than those
who rely heavily on the Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA). The province and its constituent LGUs will draft
or review its local tax policies that are aligned to physical and development strategies of the province.
LGUs will strengthen their ability to establish an enabling environment for the business sector which is
the most pragmatic way to enlarge the economic base to feed the tax base. Local taxes must be
competitive, easy to collect and administer, progressive (or pro-poor), and simple. It will also explore its
local non-tax revenue streams. There will be provisions for local revenue deductibles for those who
provide charity or zakat to avoid the incidence of double taxation. The LGUs will review and update the
Local Revenue Code to align with the Regional Revenue Code of BARMM.
The LGUs in Lanao del Sur will adopt a sustainable financial management. A multi-year budgeting will
ensure a well-thought-out planning and management of local finances especially for big projects that
require phased implementation starting from social preparation, pre-feasibility and feasibility planning,
procurement, and technical and financial evaluation all the way to actual implementation. It will strictly
implement internal and external financial and systems audits. It will adopt framework and institute
organizational processes that encourage measurement of success with verifiable outcomes and results.
Once the communications and power technology and infrastructure are installed across the province, the
LGUs will fully invest in online and automated business processing and documentation of public
transactions to fast-track service delivery, foster transparency, and reduce the ecological footprint. The
province will reassess and adopt ethical procurement policies that is congenial both to the standards on
environment and climate change (e.g. no plastic, sustainable logging, or sustainable fishery), labor
practices, do-no-harm, gender sensitivity and equal opportunity, human rights, halal requirements, and
cultural sensitivity.

6.8.7. Workforce Empowerment
The literature on workforce empowerment is quite extensive, and four things stand out that are applicable
to the Lanao del Sur local government. One, the Lanao del Sur local government will have to strengthen
its job selection and hiring processes to ensure a skilled workforce running the bureaucracy. Second,
allowing employees to access job-related skills and granting them the discretion to change the rigid public
sector work processes will have a positive impact on work performance and productivity. Third, a
performance-based reward system will be helpful. And, fourth, creating an open and positive culture at
the workplace, which encompasses from the quintessential advice on open communication to having to

112

design work areas and offices that have vast spaces for social interaction, creativity, and innovation will
boost organizational performance. Best practice has been learned that many high performing technology
companies abroad have embraced cozy, open, and well-equipped workspaces that move people (and
away from cubicles that pin employees to their private spaces) because the former sparks team spirit,
collaboration, sharing, and innovation.

6.8.8. Intergovernmental Relations
The province will pursue a partnership-based and transparent cooperation with neighboring geo-political
administrative units to advance a shared and common vision of prosperity and peace, especially for
interventions concerning:
● “commons” (e.g. watershed and marine environment)
● positive externalities (e.g. economic spillovers of Malabang-Picong port development vis-à-vis
Matanog in Maguindanao; or inter-municipal urban development within Lanao del Sur)
● negative externalities (e.g. forced displacement because of catastrophes), and
● local public goods with inter-province dimension including network infrastructures (e.g. national
roads traversing Amai Manabilang, Bumbaran, and Wao vis-à-vis Talakag in Bukidnon).
The institutional and physical aggrupation of six neighboring municipalities of Balindong (Watu), Bubong,
Ditsaan-Ramain, Marantao, Marawi City, and Saguiaran to comprise the Metropolitan Marawi for
expansion of urban development and at the pinnacle of urban hierarchy in Lanao del Sur will call for a
viable cooperation structure to be called the Metropolitan Marawi Convergence Alliance. The alliance will
lay down the code of conduct and policy frameworks for equitable sharing of burden and advantages, as
well as joint resolution and settlements of disagreements, as core elements of inter-municipal and city
collaboration. The same principle will apply to the joint collaboration of LGUs concerning the evolution
of: (1) coastal municipalities of Picong and Malabang in Lanao del Sur to an agriculture-industry port and
logistics hub that will have a significant economic spillover with the province of Maguindanao particularly
the municipality of Matanog, and (2) the landlocked municipalities of Amai Manabilang, Bumbaran, and
Wao in Lanao del Sur to be an agri-industrial cluster which will mutually benefit with the province of
Bukidnon particularly the municipalities of Maramag and Talakag. Further, an inter-municipal
collaboration will also be forged for LGUs within Lanao del Sur, according to the spatial clusters.
In general, the province LGU will strengthen intergovernmental relations to strengthen its supervisory
function over its constituent LGUs within Lanao del Sur, as well as the city/municipal government’s
supervision to the barangay level. There shall be regular inter-agency monitoring (CSC, DILG, AFP and
province) to supervise and track LGUs’ performance in relation to dispensing their regular
functions/services. Each municipal or city LGU will assign a liaison officer paid by them to be assigned or
housed at the provincial capitol to hasten coordination with the province LGU.

6.9. Peace and Security
6.9.1. Overview of Issues and Strategies: Peace and Security
The conflict situation in Lanao del Sur is multi-faceted, involving numerous armed groups formed along
political lines or with a criminal agenda. Rido or clan feud is also a constant source of vulnerability for the
citizens of the province. The triggers of a rido can be just anything from slander, misdemeanor, debt
default, damage to property, and theft to the more serious cases such as murder, land disputes, political
rivalry, election-related conflicts, sex crimes, and accidents.
Another major security issue in Lanao del Sur are the shadow economies of Illegal drugs. A sharp rise in
shadow economy-related incidents coincided with the start of President Rodrigo Duterte’s term of office,
specifically after a nationwide and coordinated anti-drug campaign was announced in July 2016.16
On top of all these threats, stability in the province faced serious threats from the armed means employed
by Moro groups in their struggle for self-determination. Over several decades, the Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF) and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) pursued their political agenda using
arms, causing severe loss of lives and properties. Both have entered their respective peace agreements
with the government, raising hopes for lasting peace. The agreement with the MNLF signed in 1996 is
deemed completed by the government. Ongoing implementation is the agreement with the MILF, which
contains the political track, which led to the creation of BARMM, and the normalization track, which
covers agreements on the decommissioning of MILF fighters and their weapons.
Splinter groups such as the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) cannot be ignored for their ability
to stage attacks.
In recent years, violent extremism emerged as the most serious threat, with disastrous consequences as
seen with the Marawi Siege in 2017. Led by the Maute Group in tandem with the Abu Sayyaf Group and
the BIFF, all pledging allegiance to ISIS, this lethal combination of firepower with extremist aims resulted
in hostage-taking, massive loss of lives and property, and subjected Christian civilians to severe forms of
abuses. Years after the siege, Marawi and its population remain in chaotic limbo, as rehabilitation and
reconstruction efforts have failed to adequately respond to the requirements to rebuild Marawi within its
socio-cultural and economic history. This has serious repercussions such the re-emergence of violence
with the mass frustration and resentment. Already, there are reports of recruitment of young people into
the extremist groups.
It is in this context that communities in Lanao del Sur, by 2040, will enjoy peace and harmony as citizens
engage more fully in community development, recognizing the efforts made by the Provincial Government
towards inclusion and reaching out to the most vulnerable.

6.9.4. Peaceful and Inclusive Communities
The Provincial Government’s inclusive work will be widely known, principally for its deliberate efforts to
mainstream support for socio-economic development of the two MILF camps (i.e., Camps Bilal and
Bushra) in the province, for the normalization process and the regional-led reforms with the creation of
the BARMM. The Provincial Government, in coordination with the joint committees managing the
implementation of the peace agreement, can take a leadership role in the provision of socio-economic
development in the two camps, integrating spatial, conflict-sensitivity and COVID-19 recovery
dimensions in its planning processes.

1.1. Location

L

anao del Sur is bounded on the east by the province of Bukidnon, on the west by the Illana Bay, on
the south by the provinces of Maguindanao and North Cotabato, and on the north by Lanao del
Norte. It surrounds the basin of Lake Lanao, the largest lake in Mindanao and second largest in the
Philippines next to Laguna de Bay. [Refer to Map 18]
Lanao del Sur has a latitude of 8° 0’ 33” and longitude of 124° 16’ 40”.
The province can be reached through three major points of entries: through the 36-kilometers (km.)
concrete highway from Iligan City, through the seaport in Malabang, and through the Narciso Ramos
National Highway from Cotabato City to Malabang. The province can also be reached through the 137km. road from Cagayan de Oro City and the Laguindingan Airport in Misamis Oriental passing through
Iligan City and Lanao del Norte. There are other outlets that drain the traffic in Lanao del Sur: 1) via
Maguing and Wao to Bukidnon leading to Cagayan de Oro or Davao and 2) via Picong (Sultan Gumander)
leading to Lanao del Norte.

1.2. Boundaries
Lanao del Sur is nestled at the heart of Mindanao at an elevation of 702 meters above sea level. The
province occupies the extensive plateau of North Central Mindanao and surrounds the basin of Lake
Lanao, the largest lake in Mindanao and the second largest in the Philippines, next to Laguna de Bay. The
province of Bukidnon bounds it on the east, Maguindanao and North Cotabato on the south, Illana Bay on
the west, and the province of Lanao del Norte on the northwest.
Lanao del Sur is enclosed within the Bukidnon-Lanao highland areas with a series of plateaus, plains,
highlands and basins, rolling hills, and volcanoes. The mountain ranges serve as a natural boundary
between Lanao Sur and Maguindanao.

1.3. Land Area
Lanao del Sur has a land area of 13,754.24 sq.km. It represents 46 percent of the total land area of the
five provinces of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. Its water surface has an area
of 387.320 sq.km. composed of lakes and swamps.
The average land area of the province is 301 square kilometers (sq. km.). The municipality of Bubong has
the largest land area of 798.50 sq. km. which is 5.88 percent of the total land area of Lanao del Sur.
Lumbaca-Unayan has the smallest land area of 42.28 sq. km. at mere 0.31 percent. [Refer to Table 16]
The land area figures in the following table were sourced from the Department of Budget and
Management. The land areas significantly diverge from the figures of PSA-NAMRIA. The LGUs, the BARMM
government, as well as the national government need to reconcile the figures since they entail serious
political and social repercussions.

Aside from Marawi City, the municipality of Bayang has the largest number of barangays, which is followed
by Bayang and Tamparan. In contrast, Sultan Dumalondong and Lumbaca-Unayan has the lowest number
of barangays: 7 and 9 barangays, respectively.
Malabang was founded through the Maura Law, which laid the foundation of municipal government in
the Philippines at the twilight of the Spanish rule in 1893. [Refer to Table 18] It was the first municipality
established by a legal mandate, nestled in the traditional geo-social and political administrative clusters
of Pat a Pängampong sa Ranaw (the four principalities of Ranaw) that thrived for centuries preceding the
Spanish global conquest. The Pat a Pängampong had its own administrative subdivisions: suku (district),
ingëd (township), and agäma (village). Refer to chapter 7 on culture and chapter 8 on governance of this
book for further discussions on traditional governance system in Lanao del Sur.
The replacement of the administrative arrangements embodied in the Pat a Pängampong with the
modern system of governance moved in a crescendo. It would take almost seven decades later (circa
1960) when the central government established two more municipalities: Balabagan and Tamparan. The
blow to the Pat a Pängampong happened a year earlier when Lanao del Sur was officially carved out of
the united Lanao (or Ranaw) province. The succeeding years witnessed more municipalities being
established: Ganassi, Piagapo, Lumba-Bayabao and Wao in 1961; and 18 more municipalities in 1963. The
126

latter included Balindong (Watu), Ditsaan-Ramain, Marantao, Masiu, Mulondo, Poona Bayabao (Gata),
Saguiaran, Taraka, Bacolod Kalawi (Bacolod Grande), Bayang, Binidayan, Butig, Madamba, Lumbatan,
Pagayawan (Tatarikan), Pualas, Tubaran, and Tugaya. And, two more in 1967: Kapai and Madalum.
The spate of dividing Lanao del Sur continued under martial law regime. About 10 were created:
Buadiposo-Buntong, Bubong, Bumbaran (Amai Manabilang), Kapatagan, Maguing, Calanogas,
Lumbayanague, Picong (Sultan Gumander) and Tagoloan II were created through presidential decrees.
The latest additions were Sultan Dumalondong and Lumbaca-Unayan established through the passage of
the ARMM’s Muslim Mindanao Act (MMA) in 1997 and 2004, respectively.
The fate of the Pat a Pängampong did not end tragically. It lost its geo-political administrative lumen, but
it still holds on its socio-cultural relevance in the Mëranaw society.

1.5. Location of the Capital
The Islamic City of Marawi is the capital of Lanao del Sur. It is located right at the northern rim of the Lake
Lanao with latitude of 8° 0’ 11.24” and longitude of 124° 17’ 6.28”. It is bounded by the municipality of
Kapai on the north, the municipalities of Bubong and Ditsaan-Ramain on the east, Saguiaran on the west,
and by the Lake Lanao on the south.
Marawi is 38 km. away from Iligan City and 130 km. away from Cagayan de Oro City, the regional center
of Northern Mindanao.
The old name of Marawi was Dansalan, a rendezvous or arrival point (dansal) from the early 1900s when
it was still under the united Lanao Province17 up until mid-1950s. It covered only of what used to be the
urban core of Marawi prior to the 2017 siege. Dansalan became the capital of Lanao Province, one of the
four districts of the Department of Mindanao and Sulu, in 1914 under the colonial America’s campaign to
subjugate the locals. Dansalan evolved into a charter city in 1940. However, it was later renamed Marawi
City in 1956—after a type of reed called rawi that abounded the waterscape of Marawi. The city traces its
metaphorical attribute (rawi or reclining) as the Agus river current pulls the reed in reclining position
downstream. In 1959, the Lanao Province was divided into two provinces: Lanao del Sur and Lanao del
Norte, and Marawi City stayed as the capital of Lanao del Sur.
Marawi City became the Islamic City of Marawi on April 15, 1980. It used to be part of Region 12 up until
2001 when it opted to be included in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM). Lanao del
Sur joined the ARMM in 1990. The city and the province are part of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region
in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) in 2019. The city is the reference point (kilometer-zero) of all roads in
Mindanao.

17

The local name of the undivided Lanao province was Ranaw.

Relative to other areas in the Philippines, Marawi City’s current population size is 1.65 times of the
population of the highly urbanized City of San Juan in Metro Manila and almost equal to the population
130

of the entire province of Ifugao in 2015. Wao and Malabang each had a population almost three-fourth
the size of the population of Pateros in Metro Manila.
The rest of the 31 municipalities of Lanao del Sur had a combined population of 599,525, or 57.3 percent
of total. Lumbaca-Unayan had the lowest population at mere 7,260 in 2015.

2.2.2. Municipal-Level Household Population
Lanao del Sur has a total of 1.038 million household population in 2015. Almost a fifth (or 29,732
households) of the total number of households in the province were concentrated in Marawi City, being
the capital followed by the other two secondary growth areas of the province: Wao and Malabang.
Maranao and Balindong, both adjacent to Marawi City, and Lumba-Bayabao, a neighbor of Wao, had high
household populations and number of households. Lumbaca-Unayan and Bumbaran were least
populated. [Refer to Table 22]
Some 23 municipalities including Marawi had household sizes greater than the province’s average of 6.49
in 2015. Leading them was Tagoloan II at 7.56 members per household, followed by Tugaya (7.53),
Pagayawan (7.17), and Mulondo (7.12). The others were Bubong, Marogong, Picong, Kapai, DitsaanRamain, Sultan Dumalondong, Taraka, Tamparan, Bayang, Saguiaran, Masiu, Marawi City, Madamba,
Lumbaca-Unayan, Maguing, Lumbatan, Malabang, and Binidayan. The municipality of Wao had the lowest
average household size at 5.07. The average household size for the Philippines was only 4.38 for the same
year.

The population growth rate of each municipality in the province was derived from the geometric growth
rate formula, given the population levels in 2010 and 2015 provided by the Philippine Statistics Authority
(PSA).
About 12 municipalities in Lanao del Sur had an annual population growth rates above the province
average of 2.89 percent in 2015: Calanogas, Bumbaran, Picong, Butig, Masiu, Piagapo, Pagayawan,
Tamparan, Lumbaca-Unayan, Poona Bayabao, Kapatagan, and Marantao. Marawi City had a population
growth rate of 1.52 percent—the fifth lowest in the province. The town of Buadiposo-Buntong had the
lowest population growth rate of 0.59 percent. [Refer to Figure 5]

2.4. Projected Population Size
At the current population growth, population in Lanao del Sur will double its 2015 level by 2045. Marawi
City will lead the population expansion in the province. [Refer to Figure 5 and Figure 6]
A high population presents both an opportunity to the province as an asset for the future workforce, if
managed properly. It can also become a liability if the population cannot avail of the soft infrastructures
to build the human capital necessary for the future. A well-equipped population and a well-managed
urbanization will be a significant boost to the province’s pursuit of sustainable economic growth and
development.

2.5. Urbanization Trend
The PSA applies the following criteria to classify a barangay an urban area: “1) it has a population size of
[at least] 5,000; 2) it has [at least] one establishment with a minimum of 100 employees; and 3) it has [at
least] five establishments with 10 to 99 employees, and [at least] five facilities within the two-kilometer
radius from the barangay hall”. Further the facilities being considered in criterion 3 include:
“municipal/city hall or provincial capitol; places where religious services are held at least once a month,
including mosques; public or town plaza or park for recreation; cemetery; market place or building where
trading activities are carried out at least once a week; public school buildings; hospital, puericulture
center, barangay health stations; fire station or public fire protection service; seaport in operation;
community waterworks system; post office or postal service; landline telephone system or calling station;
cellular phone signal; and public-street sweeper”.18
About 164,016 population across Lanao del Sur lived in barangays classified as urban areas by the PSA in
2015. This represents 15.7 percent of the total population while the rest are in rural areas.

Compared to other provinces in BARMM, the share of urban population in Lanao del Sur to its total
population is the second lowest next to Basilan at 12.2 percent. Outside BARMM, Lanao del Sur has higher
share of urban population to its total compared to Lanao del Norte excluding Iligan City (13.1 percent),
Zamboanga Sibugay (14.8 percent), Antique (11.2 percent), and Cagayan (14.8 percent).
Urban population grew annually by 33.4 percent from 2010 to 2015. Rural population on the other hand
declined by 0.28 percent annually for the same period. Malabang and Marawi City experienced an
expansion of urban population from 2010 to 2015. The following towns registered high urban population
in 2015 from zero urban population in 2010: Balabagan, Bayang, Binidayan, Bubong, Ganassi, Poona
Bayabao, Saguiaran, Tamparan, Marogong, Maguing, Picong, Lumbayanague, Kapatagan, and Sultan
Dumalondong. Wao and Bumbaran experienced a decline in their urban population. [Refer to Table 24]
The speed or tempo at which some barangays in Lanao del Sur were moving towards an urbanization
classification in 2015 was one of the fastest at 33.7 percent.

Based on the PSA data, the number of barangays categorized as urban areas increased to 76 in 2015 from
just 11 in 2010. There were a total of 1,159 barangays in Lanao del Sur as of 2015.
The PSA classifies urban barangays into three categories: “category 1 (barangays with [at least] 5,000
population size), category 2 (barangays with at least one establishment with a minimum of 100
employees), and category 3 (barangays with [at least] five establishments with 10 to 99 employees, and
[at least] five facilities within the two-kilometer radius from the barangay hall]”.19
Only four urban barangays in Lanao del Sur were under category 1, about 38 urban barangays were under
category 2, and about 34 urban barangays were category 3 in 2015. In contrast, only four, five, and two
barangays were under categories 1, 2, and 3, respectively, in 2010.

2.6. Population Density
The computation of population density in this section relies on the land area generated from the geopolitical administrative boundaries established by the PSA and the National Mapping and Resource
Information Authority (NAMRIA) and not the land area submitted to the Department of Budget and
Management in 2010.

Marawi City’s population density of 3,629.0 persons per square kilometer (sq. km.) was the highest in
Lanao del Sur in 2015. It was higher than the population density of many highly urbanized cities in the
Philippines outside of Metro Manila like Bacolod City (3,496 per sq. km.), Lucena City (3,319 per sq. km.),
Cotabato City (1,701 per sq. km), Cagayan de Oro City (1,637 per sq. km.), Olongapo City (1,637 per sq.
km.), General Santos City (1,206 per sq. km.), Tacloban City (1,200 per sq. km.), and Davao City (668 per
sq. km.). [Refer to Figure 8]

In 2045, the population density of Lanao del Sur will reach 565.8 persons per sq. km. This represents an
additional 286.3 persons per sq. km from its 2015 level.
Its capital, Marawi City, will be most densely populated at 5,709.5 persons per sq. km in 2045 or an
additional 2,080.5 persons per sq. km from its level in 2015. The population density of Marawi City by
2045 will rank among the likes of Iloilo City (5,719 persons per sq. km.) by 2015 standard and Talisay City
(5,710 persons per sq. km) in Cebu province.
By 2045, about 31 municipalities in Lanao del Sur will experience at least doubling of their initial (2015)
population densities. Leading them is Calanogas where its population density will triple. The municipalities
which will experience less than double their respective 2015 population densities area: BuadiposoBuntong, Balabagan, Tugaya, Sultan Dumalondong, Marawi City, Saguiaran, Kapai, Ditsaan-Ramain,
Lumba-Bayabao, and Bayang.

2.7. Existing Settlements
2.7.1. Built-up Areas
Marawi City, a component city, is the primary urban center of the province. People in the province
gravitates to the city because Marawi offers an array of services from health and education to commercial,
tourism, and communication. However, the 2017 siege which destroyed the urban core of the city
dramatically shifted the dense settlements to areas outside the city center and to the radial municipalities
like Saguiaran, Bubong, Marantao, mostly along the major highways, which reinforces the compact linear
settlement pattern in the province. Some residents were displaced altogether in different parts of the
country.
The major built-up areas in the province are concentrated in Marawi City and surrounding towns of
Marantao, Balindong, Saguiaran, and Ditsaan-Ramain. Malabang and Wao have significant built-up areas.
Others are located in few places at the rim of the lake such as Tamparan, Tugaya, Bayang, and Ganassi.
[Refer to Map 22]

To the south of the province, Malabang is a secondary growth area which has a potential to serve as an
agri-industrial center. The town has seaport and airport facilities, both private owned. It has historically
served as a transit area for goods and people coming from the neighboring provinces of Lanao del Norte
and Maguindanao into Marawi City and other parts of Lanao del Sur. At the same time, the inter-provincial
buses that ply from Cagayan de Oro and Iligan City to the Zamboanga Peninsula and vans for hire for those
coming from Marawi City going to Cotabato City pass by Malabang area. The town can serve as a
transportation hub and gateway to the province.
Like Malabang, the municipality of Wao is a secondary growth area and trading center to the southeastern
tip of the province serving the neighboring towns of Bumbaran and Lumba Bayabao as well as the adjacent
towns in Bukidnon and North Cotabato provinces. Wao has a tumultuous history arising from the
resettlement program of the national government beginning the 1950s until the early 1970s, which paved
way for Wao to emerge as a multi-ethnic town. Its distance to Marawi City and the rest of the province
has made Wao an enclave of Lanao del Sur, and physically and economically integrated with Bukidnon.
Lumba-Bayabao, Ditsaan-Ramain, Masiu, Tamparan, Ganassi and Lumbatan are emerging peri-urban
areas characterized as having high population density, fast-growing settlements, and with commercial
establishments. Tamparan is a transit area serving the surrounding towns to the east of the lake.
The town of Tugaya has historically been a cultural settlement. The settled town of Bayang and Malabang
trace its history as a staging point of the American campaign against the locals during the early 1900s.
The following issues are expected to affect the existing settlements: 1) the prevailing peace and order
condition of the province; 2) the rapid urbanization of certain areas, particularly trading centers and
transit towns and the densification of rural areas surrounding the Lake Lanao watershed areas; 3)
pollution problems.
The rest of the province are agricultural areas.

2.7.2. Agrarian Reform Communities
There were 236 barangays identified as Agrarian Reform Communities (or ARCs) spread across 29
municipalities in Lanao del Sur, under the Department of Agrarian Reform of the ARMM as of 2009. The
ARCs covered 124,653.43 hectares. The CARP covered about 83,413.51 hectares. The Carigongan ARC in
the municipality of Kapai covered 36 barangays, the highest number of barangays with a total agricultural
area of 38,366 hectares under served by the agrarian reform program. M.Dulay ARC in Balabagan followed
with 13 barangays covered and a total agricultural land area of 3,65 hectares. [Refer to Table 26]
On the other hand, M. Cadayonan ARC in the municipality of Taraka served only 9 barangays and it
covered a total agricultural land area of 11,741.00 hectares. The Diamaru ARC in Marogong had the least
(only two) number of barangays covered. It served 795.00 hectares of agricultural land.

Marawi City and its neighbors in Saguiaran, Marantao, Balindong (Watu), Bubong, Ditsaan-Ramain, and
Buadiposo-Buntong will comprise the Metropolitan Marawi. They also correspond to settlements with
dense built-up areas. The settlements are expected to become denser in the next two decades as a result
of twin forces of population growth and rural-to-urban migration. The total population of Metropolitan
Marawi was 349,323 in 2015. With an annual population growth rate of 1.79 percent, the cluster’s
population will reach 604,953 in 2045. Compared to the rest of the clusters, Metropolitan Marawi has the
highest population density of 980.1 persons per sq. km. in 2015 and is expected to reach 1,697.3 persons
per sq. km. in 2045. Metropolitan Marawi, which occupies only 9.5 percent of the total land area of the
province, is home to a third (33.4 percent) of Lanao del Sur’s total population in 2015. The cluster has a
total of 51,558 households. It has the highest average household size of 6.68 relative to other clusters.
[Refer to Table 27 to Table 30]
The highly settled towns of Tamparan, Taraka, Mulondo, and Poona Bayabao (Gata) can be grouped with
its less dense neighbors such as Maguing, Lumba-Bayabao, Masiu, and Butig. Together, they will constitute
a clustered community to be called the Basak Corridor to the east and southeast of Metropolitan Marawi.
The Basak Corridor accounted only 18.8 percent of the population of the province and had the highest
population growth rate of 2.72 percent compared to the other three clusters in 2015. Its population
density of 175.5 persons per sq. km. in 2015 was less than a fifth of the population density of Metropolitan
Marawi. The Basak Corridor hosted about 29,974 households. It has the second highest average
household size of 6.55.

Municipalities to the west and south of the Metropolitan Marawi, which have settlements by rim of the
lake, down to the coastal towns shall comprise the Agro-Industrial Corridor. Among its relatively densely
populated towns are: Binidayan, Bayang, Ganassi, Bacolod-Kalawi (Bacolod-Grande), Lumbayanague,
Tugaya, Lumbatan, Malabang. Its less dense neighbors will be included in the proposed corridor:
Kapatagan, Balabagan, Picong (Sultan Gumander), Sultan Dumalondong, Lumbaca-Unayan, Marogong,
Tubaran, Pagayawan (Tatarikan), Calanogas, Madalum, Pualas, Madamba, and Piagapo. The AgroIndustrial Corridor has the largest land area of 1,365.01 sq. km, the largest population 412,808 in 2015,
the second highest population growth rates, and a population density of 302.4 persons per sq. km which
is less than a third of the Metropolitan Marawi’s. The Agri- Industrial Corridor had the highest
concentration of households and household population. Its household size is 6.48 which is a little below
than the province average.
Two less dense neighboring towns of Kapai and Tagoloan II (which are both to the northeast of the
proposed Metropolitan Marawi), and the sparsely populated Bumbaran and its neighbor Wao with a

150

thriving urban area (which are both to the southwest tip of the province) shall comprise the Commercial
Crop Production Corridor. While Kapai and Tagoloan II are not adjacent to Bumbaran and Wao, the
province sees it fit to connect both of them with their potential to be a production area. The Commercial
Crop Corridor has less than a quarter (897.01 sq. km.) of Lanao del Sur’s total land area and less than a
tenth (86,326 persons) of the province’s total population in 2015. The corridor has the lowest population
density of 96.2 persons per sq. km., equivalent to almost a tenth of the Metropolitan Marawi. The
Commercial Crop Corridor had 160,132 households and the lowest average household size of 5.72.

2.9. Demographic Characteristics
2.9.1. Demographic Characteristics of the Province
The demographic structure of Lanao del Sur comprised predominantly of young population in 2015.
Almost half (45.3 percent) of its total population was below 15 years old and will continue to be so in the
next three decades. Investments in human capital formation shall be given priority by the provincial
government to support the future workforce of the provincial economy. [Refer to Figure 9]

Lanao del Sur had a total dependency ratio of 0.789 in 2015, which was higher than the national average
of just 0.577. This means that there were more persons of “economically productive” ages (between 15

years old up to 64 years old) than the dependents consisting of young (below 15 years old) and old (from
65 years old and above). [Refer to Table 31]
Mulondo was the only town in Lanao del Sur in 2015 where there were more dependents than the
population of “economically productive” ages. The total dependency ratio is 1.067, which means that for
every 100 persons of “economically productive” ages, there were 106.7 dependents. Tamparan, Kapai,
Lumba-Bayabao, Sultan Dumalondong, and Butig followed with nearly one total dependency ratios. In
contrast, the municipalities of Bubong, Madamba, Ganassi, Marantao, Bacolod-Kalawi, Tagoloan II,
Marawi City, Malabang, Wao, Bumbaran (Amai Manabilang), and Balabagan had total dependency ratios
below the province average. Balabagan had the lowest total dependency ratio of 0.623.

The total dependency ratio can be further disaggregated into the old dependency ratio and the old
dependency ratio. The young dependency ratio of the province was 0.763, which means that there were
76.3 young dependents for every 100 persons of “economically productive” ages. The old dependency
ratio was small at 0.026. That is, there were 2.6 old dependents for every 100 persons of “economically
productive” ages.
The female-to-male ratio in Lanao del Sur in 2015 was 1.040, which suggests that there were more females
than males in the province. In contrast, the national level was only 0.977. [Refer to Table 32]
In fact, Marawi City and all municipalities of Lanao del Sur except for the four towns had female-to-male
ratios that were greater than one. The municipalities of Balabagan, Madamba, Wao, and Bumbaran (Amai
Manabilang) had less than one female-to-male ratio, which indicates that there were more males than
females for the same year. Taraka and Lumbaca-Unayan had the highest female-to-male ratio in 2015 at
1.133 and 1.124, respectively.

2.9.2. Demographic Characteristics of the Functional Clusters
In terms of the emerging four functional clusters of settlements, the Basak Corridor had the highest total
dependency ratio at 0.9 in 2015. That is, for every 100 persons of “economically productive” age, there
were 90 dependents. The young dependency ratio was also the highest at 0.873. The Agri-Forestry
Industrial Corridor follows where its total dependency ratio is 0.796. Metropolitan Marawi and the
Commercial Crop Corridor had total dependency ratio below the province level: 0.741 and 0.716,
respectively. [Refer to Table 33 and Table 34]
Except for the Commercial Crop Corridor, all functional clusters in the province have female-to-male ratio
greater than 1.

2.9.3. Ethnic Diversity and Residential Segregation
The previous century saw a radical social demographic change that altered the community relations in
certain parts of the province brought about by various state-sponsored resettlement programs that
spanned more than seven decades. [Refer to Figure 10]
The Mëranaws are still the majority, but the sudden influx of people from Luzon and Visayas into Wao
and nearby areas created community discord reaching its heights in the 1970s until early 1980s. (Refer to
the chapter on culture for further details).
The communities in resettled municipalities stabilized after the martial law in the 1980s. The towns have
remained peaceful, residents from various ethnic backgrounds co-existed. However, the remnants of the
violent past are still etched in their communities through the emergence of residential segregations. This
means that they underachieve their potential to have an ethnically diverse neighborhoods. [Refer to
Figure 11]
Wao, Bumbaran (Amai Manabilang), and Balabagan are highly diverse at the municipal level, yet highly
segregated at the neighborhood level (refer to bottom right). Malabang and Tagoloan II like Iligan City in
Lanao del Norte are reasonably diverse at the municipal level, but they have a long way to go in reducing
neighborhood segregation.

Chapter 3: Environment

L

anao del Sur is endowed with bountiful natural resources that is integral in molding the present
and future development of the province in agriculture, tourism, energy, infrastructure and human
settlement. The most visible and most impactful of the province’s natural resources is the Agus
River-Lake Lanao Watershed (ARB).

3.1. General land and water characteristics and resources
3.1.1. Topography and Slope
The province of Lanao del Sur is enveloped within the Bukidnon-Lanao highland areas. Plateaus, hills,
volcanoes and mountain ranges abound the province and act as natural boundaries of Maguindanao and
North Cotabato along its southern portion. Towards the east near the Bukidnon boundary, a large lowland
area lays the Maridagao Valley. [Refer to Map 24]
Lanao has two prominent mountain ranges the Gurain and the Butig. Northwest of Lake Lanao is the
Gurain Mountain Range stretching from Balindong until Madalum whereas the Butig Mountain Range are
on the opposite side of Lake Lanao. The highest mountains in Lanao del Sur are found in the Butig
Mountain Range (also known as the Sleeping Beauty Mountain Range). This includes Mount Ragang,
Mount Magaturing and the 7th highest peak in the country, the 2,815-meter Mount Piapayungan, located
near the North Cotabato border, which is the highest point in the province. The last known volcanic
eruption of Mount Magaturing was in 1916.
Most of Lanao del Sur is landlocked except for the western municipalities of Picong, Malabang, Balabagan
and Kapatagan with shores facing Illana Bay. These municipalities are located almost on a flat or plain
terrain.

Most of Lanao del Sur is highly elevated thus its sloped characteristic. About 47.38 percent (or 635,791.89
hectares) of Lanao del Sur has a slope of eight to 18 percent classified as rolling to moderately steep. A
total of 24.60 percent (330,106.30 hectares) and 3.54 percent (47,513.62 hectares) of the land area has a
slope of zero to three percent, considered level areas, and a slope of three to eight percent, classified as
gently sloping to undulating areas, respectively. Both are mainly found in the coastal municipalities and
the Basak areas and are convenient for human settlement and agricultural cultivation. About 8.15 percent
(109,364.31 hectares) of the land has a slope of 18 percent or greater or steep areas and a further 5.34
percent (or 71,649.53 hectares) have a slope of 50 percent and above or very steep areas. Both are
considered to be highly vulnerable to landslides.

3.1.2. Land and Water Resources
3.1.2.1. Land Resources
The province surrounds the basin of Lake Lanao, the largest lake in Mindanao and second largest in the
Philippines, next to Laguna de Bay.
The land area of the province is 13,754.24 sq.km. based on the DBM figures, including the City of Marawi.
Lanao del Sur is bounded on the east by the province of Bukidnon, on west by the Illana Bay, on the South
by the provinces of Maguindanao and North Cotabato and on the Northern and Northwestern by the
Province of Lanao del Norte.
3.1.2.2. Water Resources
Surface water
The province has about 387.320 sq.km. of surface water area, composed of lakes, rivers and swamps.
There are about eight lakes in the province with a total area of 376.78 sq.km. Lake Lanao, an ancient lake
likely formed more than 100,000 years ago20, has an area of 357 sq.km., volume of 22 cub.km., and
maximum depth of 112 meters.21 It is the most famous of all water bodies in the province which is a part
of the greater Lake Lanao-Agus River watershed (ARB). [Refer to Table 36]
Another lake, Lake Dapao in Pualas, serves as a stopover on the Cotabato-Marawi route and is well-known
for its scenic beauty. Lake Putian is the 4th largest lake in Lanao del Sur and is an example of an intermittent
lake. An intermittent lake or ephemeral lake is lake which dries up seasonally.

Lanao del Sur is home to several rivers and the largest of them is the Agus River. Agus River is the only
outlet of Lake Lanao and it starts from Marawi City flowing to Saguiaran, Lanao del Norte and finally to
Iligan City. Agus 1 and Agus 2 are the only hydro-electric power plants of the Agus hydro-electric power
plant system that is within the boundaries of the province, and rest are in Lanao del Norte and Iligan City.
The Lake Lanao tributaries are relatively small rivers that fed the lake. Largest of these tributaries are the
Masiu River, Gata River, Taraka River, and Ramain River. The headwaters of these rivers mostly are on the
southeast and south side of Lake Lanao. [Refer to Map 26]
The communities along these freshwater bodies have used them for domestic use such as washing,
drinking and cooking. These waters are also used for religious purposes like ablution and ritual washing
of the dead. Based on the DENR Memorandum Circular 2014 -01, the waters of Lake Lanao is classified as
Class A. Class A waters or Public Water Supply II refer to water sources which require complete treatment
to meet the National Standards for Drinking Water (NSDW). Water treatment includes coagulation,
sedimentation, filtration and disinfection to qualify it suitable for drinking. Lakes and rivers in the province
are also used for transportation. Gravel mined in Masiu are hauled to different municipalities using lantsas
until now. The Malabang River is the main source of sand and gravel to nearby towns.
These surface waters are also used for irrigation and power generation. The rice fields of the Basak area
are irrigated naturally through rainfall, and artificially through irrigation canals with sources upstream of
the Lake Lanao tributaries. Also, as mentioned earlier, Lake Lanao serves as the water source for the Agus
hydroelectric power plant system. The Agus hydro-electric power plant is one of the remaining two power
plants under control by the national government. The other one is the Pulangi power system in Bukidnon.
The Matling River in Malabang is also utilized by Matling Industrial and Commercial Corporation for its 1.5
megawatts (MW) mini hydropower plant.
Lake Lanao-Agus River Watershed
The Lake Lanao-Agus River Watershed is a 1,645 sq.km. watershed stretching from the hinterlands of
Lanao del Sur and flowing out to Iligan City. Centered inside the watershed is Lake Lanao located 705
meters above sea level. Lake Lanao is the largest lake in Mindanao and the second largest lake after
Laguna de Bay. It is considered as one of the world’s oldest lake and was supposedly formed millions of
years ago. The entire watershed is situated in the Province of Lanao del Sur, with the province being
bounded by the Province of Lanao del Norte in the North, Bukidnon province in the East, and the provinces
of Maguindanao and Cotabato at the South and Illana Bay at the Southwest.

Lake Lanao, thru the Agus River, supplies the six hydroelectric power plants (Agus system) of the National
Power Corporation (NPC), generating 727.35 MW of electric power daily. The construction of the power
plants began in the 1970s through the RA No. 6395. The Agus hydro-electric power plant system also
includes several underground tunnels that redirect the water flow from the Agus River to seven
hydroelectric plants. Maintaining a steady supply to the Mindanao power grid is indirectly related to the
protection of watershed. This is one of the reasons that the Lake Lanao-Agus River Basin was proclaimed
a watershed forest reserved per Presidential Proclamation No. 871 in 1992.
The UPLB College of Forestry and Natural Resources and the River Basin Control Office under DENR
released the Integrated River Basin Management and Development Master Plan for the Ranao (Agus)
River Basin last December 2014. This was followed up by the establishment of the Integrated Natural
Resources and Environmental Management Project (INREMP) project which was largely funded by ADB
and IFAD last 2016, according to the DENR

Among the issues and concerns are:
1) changes in climatological conditions as manifested by
a) rainfall irregularity, intensity and erosivity, and
b) reduction in annual rainfall and rainy days
2) land degradation attributed to
a) slope and terrain of watershed
b) dislocation of timberlands in flatlands and alienable and disposable lands in slopes above 18
percent
c) deforestation
d) agricultural activities encroachment into fragile ecosystems, and
e) sand and gravel quarrying that is encroaching critical zones
3) hydrological effects and water utilization as exhibited by
a) modification the watershed’s natural hydrologic cycle and Agus River water regime due to
diversion of the waters of Agus River22
b) lack of access to potable drinking water despite the nearby lake and streams within the
watershed
c) most agricultural areas are rainfed
d) heavy siltation of the littoral zones of Lake Lanao, and
e) overdrawing of water from the lake e.g. high waterflow thru the Agus hydro-electric power
plants during dry months, and siltation in the tributaries causing shallowing.
Despite being a deep lake, heavy siltation of Lake Lanao will seriously affect the volume of water that the
lake can store and drop the dynamic head that is needed to drive all the hydro-electric power plants of
the NPC. Without adequate and sustained interventions in the Lake Lanao watershed, the prospects for
Mindanao would remain grim and more so in the distant future.23
The diminishing inflow of the watershed around the lake with its associated rivers has suffered from
rampant timber poaching and conversion to farms (shifting cultivation) over the years. [Refer to Map 28
and Table 38]
Soil erosion, destruction of freshwater coastal areas, improper disposal of solid waste materials and loss
of biodiversity, resulted to the heavy siltation of the major river outlets causing perennial flash floods.
Sewage and agricultural run-off also contributed substantially to the deterioration of water quality. As a
result, the water flowing into and from the lake has been reduced drastically. Also issues regarding the
Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC) given to NPC regarding the Agus hydro-electric power plants
has not been complied until now. Compliance with the ECC will mitigate the impacts of the direct damming
of Lake Lanao and Agus River.

Lake Lanao Watershed Protection and Development Council (LLWPDC) was created thru Presidential
Memorandum Order No. 421 of 1992 and delegated the primary task to formulate the implementation
plan for the protection and management of watershed area, the procurement and installation of hydraulic
monitoring devices, the establishment of a watershed data bank, the conduct of watershed studies and
the preparation of policy recommendations. The LLWPDC is headed by the DENR Secretary and its
members include various stakeholders such as LGUs and local NGOs. Despite this, proper implementation
of the mandate of the LLWDC is still have to be seen.
RA No. 7586 designated Lake Lanao as an initial component of the National Integrated Protected Areas
System (NIPAS) Law. The Protected Area Management Board was only organized on January 12, 2011.
Initial meetings of the board have already indicated the member’s apparent reservations in solving Lake
Lanao’s continuing environmental degradation. The new BARMM government thru the recently enacted
Bangsamoro Organic Law will replace the management of Lake Lanao-Agus River Basin from the national
government thru NIPAS to the BARMM government. However, three years from the ratification of the
BOL, there is still yet to be a formal transfer of management.
Citing Dr. Thomas Ballatore of Shiga University dated 18 February 2010 during the EcoGov Project in the
Lake Lanao watershed, the following are existing laws that created conflict in supervision, management,
and control over the Lake Lanao-Agus River Basin:
a) “PD 705, series of 1975. The Revised Forestry Code of the Philippines
Under Section 3 of this PD, critical watershed is defined as a drainage area of a river system supporting
existing and proposed hydro-electric power and irrigation works needing immediate rehabilitation as it is
being subjected to a fast denudation causing accelerated erosion and destructive floods. It is closed from

logging until it is fully rehabilitated. By operation of the law, Lake Lanao Watershed is within the
jurisdiction of the National Government through the then Bureau of Forest Development which had
jurisdiction over all forestlands in the country. The Bureau is directly under the control and supervision
of the Secretary of the Department of Natural Resources (Section 7).
b) Executive Order No. 425
The Regional Environment and Natural Resources is mandated to ensure environmental protection and
sustainable development as well as the authority, power, and right to explore, develop and utilize the
natural resources including surface and sub- surface rights, in-land and coastal water, and renewable and
no-renewable resources in the Autonomous Region.
c) RA No. 9054, series of 2001 – Amending Republic Act No. 6734
Section 8, Article III of this Act (Guiding Principles and Policies) states that subject to the Provision of the
Constitution and this Organic Act, the Regional Government shall have the authority, power, and right to
explore, develop and utilize the natural resources, including surface and subsurface rights, in-land and
coastal waters, and renewable and non-renewable resources in the Autonomous Region. Muslims and
the other indigenous cultural communities shall, however, have priority rights to explore, develop, and
utilize the said resources in the areas designated as parts of their respective ancestral domains.
Also explicitly provided in this Act is the mandatory earmarking of funds for forest development. Under
Section 5 Article X (Ancestral Domain, Ancestral Lands and Agrarian Reform), paragraph 4 states that ten
Percent (10 percent) of the shares of the internal revenue taxes of the Regional Government and of the
provinces, cities, municipalities, and barangays of the autonomous region and all allocations for the
development of the autonomous region by the National Government shall be devoted to reforestation
projects and other environmental activities to enhance the protection and development of the
environment in the autonomous region.
With respect to management of natural resources, including [Lake Lanao Watershed], Section 5 of Article
XII (Economy And Patrimony) provides that the control and supervision over the exploration, utilization,
development, and protection of the mines and minerals and other natural resources within the
autonomous region are hereby vested in the Regional Government in accordance with the Constitution
and the pertinent provisions of this Organic Act except for the strategic minerals such as uranium,
petroleum and other fossil fuels, mineral oils, and all sources of potential energy, as well as national
reserves and aquatic parks, forest and watershed reservations already delimited by authority of the
central government or national government.
d) RA No. 7586, series of 1992 – Establishment and Management of National Integrated Protected
Areas System (NIPAS)

170

Section 5 of this law provides that all areas or islands in the Philippines proclaimed, designated or set
aside, pursuant to a law, presidential decree, presidential proclamation or executive order as national
park, game refuge, bird and wildlife sanctuary, wilderness area, strict nature reserve, watershed,
mangrove reserve, fish sanctuary, natural and historical landmark, protected and managed
landscape/seascape as well as identified virgin forests before the effectivity of this Act are hereby
designated as initial components of the system. This law effectively puts LLW as initial component of the
NIPAS and hence, placed under the control and administration of the DENR (national). It also provides for
the creation of a Protected Area and Wildlife Division in each Region under the supervision of RTD.
Section 11 of this Act also provides for the creation of a Protected Area Management Board for each of
the established protected area to be chaired by the RED in the Region.
e) RA No. 6734, series of 1989 — Creating the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao
Under Article XIII of RA 6734 (Economy And Patrimony), Section 2 states that except for strategic minerals
such as uranium, coal, petroleum and other fossil fuels, mineral oils, all sources of potential energy, as
well as national reserves and aquatic parks, forest and watershed reservations as maybe delimited by
national law, the control and supervision over the exploitation, utilization and development of the natural
resources of the Autonomous Region is hereby delegated to the Regional Government in accordance with
the Constitution and national laws. This provision exempts [Lake Lanao Watershed], which is a critical
watershed, from the delegated jurisdiction to the Autonomous Region.
f) RA No. 6395, series of 1971:
Authorized NPC to exercise complete jurisdiction and control over watersheds surrounding the reservoirs
of power plants and power projects.
g) Executive order no. 224 s. 1987:
Vesting on the national power corporation the complete jurisdiction, control and regulation over
watershed areas and reservations surrounding its power generating plants and properties of said
corporation.
h) R.A. 9136 ([Electric Power Industry Reform Act] EPIRA LAW of 2001) Section 34 (d):
NPC is mandated to manage and continue to be responsible for the management and rehabilitation of
watershed areas with major hydropower plants.”
Groundwater
Some of the pumping stations of the Marawi City Water District such as the one in Barangay Bangon are
extracting water from groundwater sources. Most of the residents of Lanao del Sur that do not have
access to public water utility use shallow-tube wells as well as deep wells for water supply.
Vision 2040

171

In some parts of LDS, especially in Marawi City, have experienced problems in groundwater recharge. For
the last five years, some households and pumping stations such as the ones in MSU - Marawi City cannot
pump out water during months of May until September. This can be attributed to 1) over extraction 2)
climate change and 3) loss of porosity of the aquifer. [Refer to Map 29]

3.1.3. Geological Features
Lanao del Sur is mountainous in nature. The 35,574-ha Lake Lanao which serves as the highlight hydrogeographical feature of Lanao del Sur is located 705 meters above sea level. The eastern part of the
province is the Mt. Piagayungan Range which includes Mt. Piagayungan and Mt. Ragang, two of the
highest mountains in the country. Situated west of Lake Lanao is the Mt. Gurain Mountain Range.
Southwest of the province are the coastal plains that finally reach the Illana Bay. [Refer to Map 30]

3.1.4. Mineral Resources
There are several limestone mountains/ hills in Lanao del Sur. Some of which are being quarried just like
in Ditsaan-Ramain. Sand and gravel mining are well-known products of Masiu and Malabang. Other
mineral resources of the province are unfortunately have not yet been explored and there is no data up
to date. The PLGU is open to the opportunity of exploring the mineral resources of the province with the
help from other national and regional agencies such as DENR-MGB and MENRE.
The Bureau of Soils identified 11 types of soil common in the province, a large portion of which is suitable
for rice and a corn. Salaman Loam clay accounts for 0.52 percent, Ramain and Buaya-an loam clay with
0.50 percent, and Pu-an loam clay with 0.21 percent. All these are identified as good types of land suitable
for agricultural cultivation. [Refer to Table 39, Map 31, and Map 32]
The moderately good type of soil is the Binidayan silt loam, which is 11.1 percent, while the fairly good
soil but limited for cultivation are the Adtuyo clay loam, Langkong Sandy loam and Kundarangan clay loam
comprising about 33.3 percent land with a soil type limited to pasture and forest are the Malabang sandy
loam, Adtuyo-bam Castillan Complex, Caromatan Silt Loam, Bolinao Silt loam, Kidapawan clay loam and
Jansan clay loam with an aggregate 15.62 percent. Land with a soil type suitable for forestry is the
mountain soil with 30.15 percent. Another soil type is the Kudarang loam clay which comprises about
30.15 percent.

3.1.5. Climate
According to the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration
(PAGASA) climate classification, Lanao del Sur has a Type III climate. [Refer to Map 33] A Type III climate
has seasons which are not very pronounced, relatively dry from November to April, and wet during the
rest of the year.24 Due to its mountainous nature, the province experiences significant differences in
rainfall within. This is due to the occurrence of orographic rain which is defined as precipitation coming
directly from a maritime air mass that cools when flowing over mountains.25 Hence, the World
Meteorological Organization advised countries to have at least one weather station per 25 to 1000 sq.
km.26
In the province, there is presently one PAGASA Agrometeorological Station in the Mindanao State
University (MSU) in Marawi. There are also nine rain gauges administered by NPC within the Lake LanaoAgus River Basin. However, these data are not directly shared to PAGASA thus acquisition of the data has
to go through NAPOCOR bureaucracy.

The National Structural Code of the Philippines places the province of Lanao del Sur within Zone III which
has average windspeed of 125 kilometers per hour (kph). However, wind map from Global World Atlas, a
World Bank funded website, shows that average is around 4 meters per second (m/s) which is not suitable
for large wind turbines. [Refer to Map 34]

3.1.6. Biodiversity
Lanao del Sur is home to several endemic species and highly endangered species. [Refer to Table 42 and
Table 43] For example, several cyprinid species are only found in Lake Lanao most of which are either
critically endangered or extinct.27 The Lake Lanao eco-region is also home to 41 endemic freshwater crab
species and supports a large number of waterfowls. The remaining major fish species found in Lake Lanao
are shown in table below.28 The lake is also home to a diverse group of freshwater molluscs (viviparid
gastropods) which indicates that from a biological perspective, Lake Lanao is an ancient lake (more than
100,000 years) due to the morphological and genetic diversity of the vivaparids.29

However, for the last five decades, Agus River, Lake Lanao and its tributaries experienced dramatic water
regime shifts mainly due to damming. This, nutrient loading and the introduction of invasive species have
dramatically worsened the fish biodiversity within the Lake Lanao-Agus River watershed.30
The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) recently declared that 15 endemic cyprinid
species in Lake Lanao are extinct.

Lanao del Sur is also one of the places in the country where there are intact virgin forests. These are mostly
found on the eastern part of the Lake Lanao watershed. These forests serve as important habitat to
Philippine eagles (Pithecophaga jefferyi). However, the places are on red alert according to Global Forest
Watch due to excessive illegal logging for the past several years.31 Almost 90 percent of the alienable and
disposable lands including most of the lake shoreline and the adjacent lowland forest areas have been
transformed to agricultural lands (87 percent), while 0.4 percent are now urban and rural settlements.32
However, due to the recent 2017 siege in Marawi, urban centers have been cropping up rapidly from
outside the urban core (dubbed as the most-affected areas) to Saguiaran, Ramain, Mulondo and
Marantao. Land conversion due to in-migration must be arrested to preserve and improve the present
biodiversity.
The Philippine crocodile (Crocodylus mindorensis) is categorized by the International Union for
Conservation of Nature as “critically endangered,” with its population estimated at between 92 and 137
in 2012. The tributaries of Lake Lanao served as habitat for most endangered crocodile species, the
Philippine crocodile however none can be seen there as of today due to poaching, loss of food and habitat
loss.33 Presently there have been sightings of the Philippine crocodile in the deltas of Malabang.34

3.2. Land Use Potentials and Constraints
Lands used for agriculture is around 140,111 hectares however some of it have been covered with forest
growth (868 hectares).35 Unfortunately, most of forest cover is decreasing due to illegal logging and
kaingin activities. According to Global Forest Watch in 2020, Lanao del Sur has lost around 5,510 hectares
of humid primary forest from 2010 to 2019.

3.2.1. Land Classification
Based on the Philippine Forestry Statistics of the Forest Management Bureau in 2019, there are around
133,135 hectares of Certified Alienable and Disposable Land. Relying on the NAMRIA Land Classification
data, the DENR was able to identify about 19 percent (or 254,154 hectares) of total land area of Lanao del
Sur as forestland. [Refer to Table 44]. Note that the figures on forestland based on the land classification
maps are different from when data are extrapolated from land cover maps. Under land classification, all
land with a slope of 18 percent are considered forestland (even if there are no forests).

3.2.2. Land Cover
Using NAMRIA’s land cover which relies of satellite imagery or aerial photos places the forestland of Lanao
del Sur at 46.91 percent of the total land area of the province. This is significantly higher than the
forestland identified under land classification based on slope. Bubong, Lumba Bayabao, and Tagoloan II
have forestland greater than 80 percent of their respective total municipal land areas. Municipalities
without forests are Balabagan, Bayang, Binidayan, Marantao, Tamparan, Taraka, Tubaran, and
Lumbayanague. About 51.71 percent of the province’s total land area are grasslands and agriculture land.
Only 0.78 percent are built-up areas. [Refer to Table 45]

Different sources provide different percentage share of land are devoted to the type of land use data,
based on land cover. The closest figures on land use generated from 2010 NAMRIA’s satellite imageries
and aerial photos were derived from the Open Street Map’s (OSM) land cover in 2020. The OSM places
Lanao del Sur’s forestland at 51.4 percent of total provincial land area. The rest are grassland/agriculture
(47.04 percent), built-up areas (1.43 percent), and others (0.00 percent). The data set also confirms that
Bubong, Butig, and Lumba-Bayabao to have more than 80 percent of their respective total municipal land
area as forestland. Tagoloan II has 96.74 percent forestland. [Refer to Map 36 and Table 46].

3.2.3. Land Suitability
Land suitability is the classification of lands into categories based on the degree which the physical
characteristics of the land can satisfy the environmental requirements of specific crops without
deteriorating the land. [Refer to Map 39]
A large portion in the Bubong, Maguing, Lumba Bayabao, Butig, Bumbaran (Amai Manabilang), and Wao
are suited for forest plantation. Their forest lands are covered with thick foliage and have potentials for
non-timber industries. Timber industry should be avoided given the adverse effects of forest
encroachment and changes in the micro-climate in Lanao del Sur.
A significant area of the province with slope limit of 18 percent and below and with proportionate soil
depth covers the Kapai, Tagoloan, Wao, Butig, Lumbatan, Bayang, Binidayan, Ganassi, Madamba, Pualas,
Calanogas, Kapatagan, Picong (Sultan Gumander), Madalum, Tugaya, Piagapo, Balindong, Saguiaran and
Marawi City. They are suited for perennial trees and vine crops. These areas are not prone to flooding and
drainage problem and no serious limitation in their terrain.
Kapai, Bubong and Pualas, Lumba-Bayabao, Marogong, Kapatagan, Balabagan, Malabang, Picong (Sultan
Gumander), Bacolod Grande, Balindong, Marantao and Piagapo are perfect places for the production of
commercial crops such as corn, sugarcane and wide variety of vegetable. The topography of these
municipalities has a slope limit of 8 percent and below. Erosion is low.
Bubong, Ditsaan-Ramain, Buadipos-Buntong, Mulondo, Taraka, Tamparan, Poona Bayabao and Masiu and
in some areas in Bubong, Lumbayanague, Tubaran, Marawi City, Marantao, Kapai and Tagoloan have slope
limits up to 3 percent with low soil permeability. The area has a natural advantage for rice paddies. Water
supply for the basak areas comes from river based irrigation system or community irrigation projects
present in the localities.

3.2.4. Protection Areas
The whole Lake Lanao-Agus River Basin, or as written in PD 871 as lake Lanao Watershed Forest Reserve,
is a protected area. A much older law, RA 4190, declares the following places in the province as national
parks:
(a) Rungkunan Park, located in the Municipality of Ramain
(b) Lake Dapao, located in the Municipality of Pualas
(c) Lake Butig, located in the Municipality of Butig
(d) Sacred Mountain together with all the lands therein, located in Marawi City
(e) Salikata Park, located in the Municipality of Lumba Bayabao, and
(f) Pantuwaraya Lake, located in Saguiaran
Due to the recent pandemic, several ecotourist spots have sprung up. These are the Slangan Island and
Taytay Ridge in Balindong, Binidayan Lake View, Lake Dapao in Pualas and Butig Natures View among
others. Promotion of ecotourism is considered by the PLGU as a major objective in helping the local
economy as well as preserving the environment.
Due to the mountainous nature of the province, more than 60 percent of the land area has a slope of 50
percent or more. These areas are prone to landslides therefore must have minimal human settlements.
Mountain areas such as the Piagayungan Mountain Range is one of the sanctuaries of Philippine Eagle and
other wildlife species in Mindanao. Mt. Piagayungan as well as Mount Ragang and Mount Makaturing (or
Magaturing) of Piagayungan Mountain Range have elevations of more than 2000 meters. Due to the
absent or lack of Provincial Environmental Code, timber poaching activities is rampant. The Lake Lanao
River Basin has suffered from forest degradation. From 2001 to 2017 huge hectares (about 10,927
hectares) in the mountainous area of Lanao del Sur were degraded resulting. Bumbaran (Amai
Manabilang), Maguing, Marogong, Wao, Butig, Kapatagan, Picong, Tagoloan II, Balabagan and Marawi
City experienced forest degradation. For the Lake Lanao-Agus River Basin, around three thousand eight
hundred and sixty-one hectares were degraded from 2001 to 2017
The Piagayungan Mountain Range and Lake Lanao are defined by the DENR – BMB in 2016 as key
biodiversity areas within the country. It would be beneficial that parts of the Malabang be considered also
as KBAs to protect the threatened Philippine freshwater crocodiles (Crocodilus mindorensis). Lanao del
Sur has around 620 hectares of mangrove forests.36 These are all found in the coastal municipalities of
Picong, Balabagan, Malabang and Kapatagan. These mangrove forests and rivers at Sultan Gumander and
Malabang were found to have thriving population of Philippine freshwater crocodiles. The Crocodylus
porosus Philippines Inc. reported that there least 20 Philippine freshwater crocodiles in Malabang and

36

Long and Giri (2011)

194

with additional research, there could be more discoveries in the adjacent river deltas towards the
mountain areas of Lanao del Sur.37
Riverbank erosion is rampant in the tributaries of Lake Lanao especially river reaches and river meanders
in the Basak areas. The Basak area is naturally an alluvial floodplain. [Refer to Map 40 and Map 41] Its soil
is characterized as having silty loam consistency. Many houses and infrastructures are exposed to
disasters because the structures are constructed along riverbanks. To arrest the ongoing erosion,
downstream areas such as the municipality of Taraka channelized parts of the Taraka River.

3.3. Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk Reduction and Management
Some areas in Lanao del Sur are vulnerable to various types of natural hazards ranging from volcanic,
seismic, atmospheric, hydrologic, and even biological phenomena. Some settlements are exposed to
these hazards threatening the population and their economic, cultural, and environmental assets. Some
of the risks they are exposed to include flooding, typhoons, landslide and subsidence, and earthquakes.
[Refer to Map 42]
Because of unmanaged urbanization and rapid densification, some municipalities are exposed to multiple
risks.

3.3.1. Typhoons
Lanao del Sur, much like all the of the country, is highly prone to risks brought about by climate change.
The province is outside the Philippine typhoon belt and has not experienced any typhoons from the 1980s
until 2010. However Tropical Storm Sendong in 2011 and Typhoon Vinta in 2017 severely impacted the
province in the recent decade. Both storms have caused more than 50 percent flooding in the towns of
Ditsaan-Ramain, Bubong, Mulondo, Taraka and Tamparan as well as landslides in Marawi City, Kapai and
Saguiaran. Typhoon Vinta arrived two months after Marawi was “liberated” from the pro-ISIS militants
which added more distress to the displaced people of Lanao del Sur.

3.3.2. Earthquakes and Tsunamis
Earthquakes are cause of great concern to the people of Lanao del Sur. Last year, successive earthquakes
of more than magnitude 6.0 with epicenters in North Cotabato and Davao reached Lanao del Sur. The
damage was minimal compared to the 1955 Lanao quake and the 1976 Moro Gulf quake. The 1955 quake
caused around 400 deaths and a seiche (water oscillation due to earthquake) in Lake Lanao.38 Several fault
lines run through Lanao del Sur and some of them sit right under densely populated areas such as
Barangay Sagonsongan in Marawi City. The 1976 Moro Gulf Quake reached a magnitude of 7.9 in Richter
scale. The quake caused a tsunami which hit the coasts of Picong (Sultan Gumander), Malabang and
Kapatagan. Last April 2017, a magnitude 6.0 shook parts of Mindanao with epicenter at Wao.
Areas with volcanoes are susceptible to earthquakes. According to PHILVOLCS, there are two major
volcanic complexes in Lanao del Sur namely the Lanao Volcanic Complex and the Piagayungan Volcanic
Complex.

3.3.3. Flooding
The floodplains of four major tributaries of the Lake Lanao Agus River Watershed, locally known as the
Basak area, are highly prone to flooding especially during high rainfall intensity. [Refer to Map 43]
As previously mentioned, the location were flooded ranging from several centimeters up to two meters
in height. High population density areas such as Basak Malutlut in Marawi City are also at risk of flooding
despite being in a relatively higher elevation due to buildings obstructing the downward flow of water to
Lake Lanao.
The coastal communities are also susceptible to storm surge. [Refer to Map 44]

3.3.4. Landslides
Due to its mountainous characteristic, the province is highly vulnerable to landslides. This is highly
problematic since there is a growing number of residential homes in those landslide-prone areas such as
in Barangay Boganga and Barangay Gadungan, Marawi City as well as mountainside municipalities of
Tugaya, Bacolod-Kalawi, Madalum and Madamba. The mentioned municipalities were hardly-hit by
landslides during Typhoon Vinta. Natural-made disasters are inevitable however their impacts can be
mitigated. [Refer to Map 45]

3.4. Waste Management
3.4.1. Municipal Solid Waste Management
As per Unified Bangsamoro Development Plan of the Bangsamoro autonomous government, there is only
one open dumpsite in the whole BARMM region which is the one in Barangay Papandayan, Marawi City.
This is problematic since the population of the province, which is directly proportional to MSW, is growing
aside from the fact that the said dumpsite is within the Agus River watershed.
In 2015, the population was around 1.045 million which is forecasted to reach 1.861 million people by
2040. Per capita average waste generation is 0.34 kg/capita/day which means that the population may
produce around 632 tons of waste per day in 2040. Increase of population which create high degree of
pollution and wastes that can result to a negative effect on the social, physical and economic well-being
of the populace. Problems in solid waste management is less of a priority of residents due to lack of
awareness and information what negative effects may bring to them.
Negative impacts of improper waste disposal includes proliferation of flies, rats and other unwanted pests,
clogging of natural and man-made drainage systems resulting to flooding, leaching of hazardous liquids
to surface and groundwater, increase in health problems and bad aesthetics among others.
Comparison:
a) Un-cleaned surroundings almost all of the communities in Lanao del Sur.
b) Improper solid waste disposal anywhere in open areas, including the Lake Lanao.
c) Lack of ordinance on solid waste management.
d) Lack of information dissemination about the importance of proper disposal and how it will affect
our health and environment.
e) Usage of plastic or cellophanes for packaging.
f) Unavailability of garbage truck and garbage collectors in most of municipalities.
g) Lack of Dump Site
h) Lack of Material Recovery Facility
i) Lack of cooperation of the people in the community

3.4.2. Water Pollution
A 2015 study shows that Lake Lanao waters reached Class A grade as per DENR standards for fresh surface
water.39 Despite this, increasing population will impact water resources especially that none of the coastal
towns surrounding the lake has a functional sewage system that filters waste. Waste matters from sewers,
garbage, and open dumpsite get into canals, creek, stream, and which, in turn flow into the lake as catch
basin. Surface waters such as Lake Lanao is experiencing high nutrient loading causing proliferation of

39

water hyacinths in the lake and high algal growth in several areas. Water quality indicator bacteria in Lake
Lanao goes beyond the accepted value of the heterotrophic plate count or HPC (HPC >500 CFU/ml) and
the total coliform most probable number or MPN (MPN >16/100ml).40 This poses a problem since people
in coastal communities along Lake Lanao still drink water from the lake.

Chapter 4: Economy
4.1. Economic Structure of Lanao del Sur

S

ustained economic growth in Lanao del Sur has been limited without structural transformation.
Its economy has not substantially diversified.

Data on value of production, much more value added production accounts, across industries in the
province is not available. Profile of the economic structure of Lanao del Sur is confined on the number of
establishments operating. This report recognizes the serious under-reporting entailed in number of
establishments statistics of the Department of Trade and Industry-Business Name Registration System
(DTI-BNRS) because a substantial number of businesses in the region are unregistered and are in the
informal sector. Many businesses still do not have offices or shops, and business owners operate at home
which also serve as their warehouses.
Based on the 2018 number of establishments, Lanao del Sur had specialization in trade, manufacturing,
hospitality services. Trade led the industry at 56.7 percent of total number of establishments in 2018.
Manufacturing (16.3 percent), hospitality services which include accommodation and food services (11.3
percent), and education services (5.3 percent) followed. Agriculture, forestry, and fishing came in fifth
(3.9 percent). These industries are the relative specialization of the province. [Refer to Table 47 and Figure
12]
Lanao del Sur’s neighbors followed similar patterns of industries—at least for the top three industries.
Financial services or other services followed.

The Family Income and Expenditure Survey in 2000 paints a different picture. Agriculture (65.2 percent of
total) was the primary source of income of households in Lanao del Sur. This could be interpreted as the
major industry in the province for the year. Trade (18.9 percent), transportation (7.8 percent), and fishing
(two percent) industries followed agriculture. [Refer to Figure 13]

208

While the conclusions derived from the DTI BNRS data in 2018 and the PSA FIES data on major source of
income in 2000 diverge, Lanao del Sur believed that there was no deep structural transformation that had
taken place in the province for the past two decades. Rather, the datasets suffered from measurement
error given the context of Lanao del Sur.

In terms of relative concentration of industries, sand quarrying was dominated by Lanao del Sur in 2018.
Agriculture was a significant industry in the province, but its competitors Bukidnon led the industry.
Similarly, manufacturing and education were important industries in Lanao del Sur, but they were
concentrated in Misamis Oriental, particularly Cagayan de Oro City. [Refer to Table 48]

4.1.1. Significance of Agriculture and Fishery
Farming is the most feasible and viable economic activities that can bring promising return in terms of
gains and profit. The land is fertile and suitable for almost all types of crops.
Currently, there are four big agricultural firms that operate in the province. Except for Matling Corporation
which engages in manufacturing of cassava products, the remaining three are exports agricultural
commodities either in their raw form as consumption goods or as intermediate goods to be processed in
their mother companies located outside Lanao del Sur. The Mt. Kalatungan Agri-Ventures, Inc. located at
Bumbaran exports banana cavendish to neighboring Asian countries including China and the Middle East.
The Itil Plantation, Inc. in Balabagan produces industrial root crops with Manila and Cebu as its major
market. Lastly, the Wao Development Corporation exports fresh pineapple. Other identified agriculture
industrial establishments are the Lobregat Family Milling Corporation, Balabagan Agricultural
Corporation, and the Balabagan Coconut Enterprises, INC. all located in Lorenzo, Balabagan.
Apart from these big corporations, agriculture at the household and community level has not achieved its
potentials, which is currently characterized by low productivity among farmers and fishers. Farmers have
limited access to capital. They also experience high cost of farm inputs, lack of new suitable technology,
and inefficient irrigation system. After harvest, farmers still have to face the challenges of lack of postharvest facilities and inefficient marketing system. As a result most the of the agricultural goods for
consumption by the residents in Lanao del Sur are imported from Lanao del Norte and Cagayan de Oro.
Corn, cassava, and abaca are exported outside the province in their raw forms.
The fishery sector has a muted share in the overall economy, yet vital to the food culture in the province
and the neighboring provinces. Just like farmers, they have limited access to capital and are directly
exposed to the vagaries of fuel prices. The coastal and inland fishing community do not have community
fish landing and cold storage facilities. Fishers in the coastal communities are vulnerable to the predatory
market capture of middlemen, many of them based in Lanao del Norte who provided the former capital
and cash for the former’s families to get by. This arrangement limits the trade flow of marine fish products

210

to Marawi City and the rest of Lanao del Sur and instead encouraged domestic trade of largely raw or
unprocessed fish to the Lanao del Norte. Local fishers hence commanded low profit margin of their
produce. Marawi and the rest of Lanao del Sur had to rely on marine fish imports from Iligan City.
The promise of high returns in industry and services outside Lanao del Sur encouraged many young locals
to find employment in those sectors leaving the agriculture sector drained of workers especially among
the young population. Mëranaw farmers have started to grow old, and only few are replacing our old
farmers. The average age of farmers is 57 years old. And the youth are no longer interested in agriculture.
Today’s youth are tomorrow’s family farmers and maintaining interest in farming as a profession is vital
to future food security. The province needs to ensure that young people have access to markets, goods
and service, employment opportunities, and leisure so that they want to stay on the farm.
Most of the farms are have already shrunk in size due to the fast growth of our population. The province
needs to build more houses, sacrificing the agricultural sector. The remaining farmlands are facing the
problem of soil degradation and climate change. The soil quality declines due to excessive use of chemical
fertilizers. The planting calendar also shifts due to climate change.
In spite of the negative trends the agriculture sector is facing, some areas are heading towards a positive
direction. Due to little income in rice and corn production, farmers are shifting to abaca, coconut, coffee,
and cacao production which offers more promising income.
Recently, the provincial government has identified coffee and abaca among its priority products for
development through partnerships with various groups. The provincial government signed two
agreements during the Marawi-Lanao Agribusiness Forum and Market Matching for the developments of
the two crops thru Strengthening Urban Resilience for Growth with Equity (SURGE) Project, funded by
USAID and supported by Bangon Marawi Chamber of Commerce and Industry. One of the agreements is
with the Philippine Coffee Board, and the other with the Philippine Fiber Industry Development Authority
and NewTech Pulp, a private company, to initiate action plans to expand abaca production and villagelevel processing in the province. This was intended to help farmers gain market information on viable
agricultural crops and the opportunity to forge partnerships with key private companies.
The manufacturing sector of Lanao del Sur is highly dominated by the processing of agricultural products
like palm oil in the Municipality of Wao, cassava starch in Malabang, and banana in Bumbaran (Amai
Manabilang). The sector contributes little in the total investments in the province, thus it is apparent that
it is yet to be developed. It should be noted however that there are potentials that abound for the sector.
Palm oil processing could be expanded given the growing demand in Asia. Bio-ethanol production is also
a promising venture as this could be sourced out from cassava and sugarcane which are some of the top
commodities in the province.
The province also sees agriculture as a way to achieve peace and stability. The province is supporting the
“From Arms to Farms” Program of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Agrarian Reform. The
program’s purpose is “Fostering Peace through Agriculture & Fishery Development in Conflict Areas of the
Vision 2040

Philippines”. It was crafted to help war torn families and former rebels to battle against hunger through
farming. Their farms are used as the learning site or school for practical agriculture. From rebels, they
were transformed to returnees, to farmers, then to agriculture educators. More than that and despite
struggling to maintain positive peace, they eventually up-scaled to become agri-preneurs while their once
idle land was improved to become a farm tourism destination.
According to the data gathered from PSA, regionwide, Lanao del Sur is the top poultry and egg producer;
second to Maguindanao in rice, corn, and other crop production; second to Basilan in livestock raising;
third in fisheries.
On the national level, Lanao del Sur is one the lowest producer. According to the data from PSA, in terms
of rice production, Lanao del Sur produced only 199,964 metric tons (MT) on its 69,801 hectares rice
farms. This is very small compared to the 1,886,708.93 MT on the 333,177 hectares rice farm area of
Nueva Ecija and 1,188,685.OO MT on the 281,326 hectares of Isabela.
The irony of rice farmers is they still buy their vegetables from the market. Farmers in the province do not
practice multiple cropping. Farmers from other provinces plant vegetables alongside rice, providing an
alternative source of income or more food for the farmer's family.
Since most poor households live in rural areas where agriculture is the main source of livelihood, a
rebound in the agricultural sector is expected to benefit the poor. About 37.7 percent total income of the
province relies on agriculture. Therefore, improving agricultural productivity is a means to raise the
income of the poor and help accelerate poverty reduction.
Also, if the slow progress of the agriculture sector continues, Lanao del Sur could possibly face food
insecurity.

4.1.2. Significance of Trade
Wholesale and retail trade is the lifeblood of the Mëranaws. Many of the goods being traded are imported
consumption goods (ranging from food and textiles to durable goods such as personal electronics and
jewelry) brought from abroad such as Saudi Arabia and China, and other parts of the Philippines like
Cagayan de Oro City, Iligan City, and Metro Manila. Barter goods from the neighboring countries in
southeast Asia were a common sight, but the shift in the patterns of trade has made goods from China
more attractive because they are cheaper. Very few locally produced goods are being traded within and
outside the province, and they are confined to artisanal products.
There are many local players in the wholesale and retail trade, and it is safe to assume that the market is
saturated. It is a common observation that in many public markets and commercial districts, a line of
traders practically sell an array of the same, if not similar, goods driving the prices down. Some migrate
to other parts of the country and engage in trading activities where they command higher economic

212

returns. They repatriate their earnings to their families in Lanao del Sur, which are used, in turn, to invest
in more micro businesses in the service sector.
In Lanao del Sur, traders operate as micro establishments, many of them are unregistered, hence, in the
informal sector with shops and warehouses mostly attached to their homes. Almost all traders are selfemployed. All members of families help in the business so that trading is a family affair.

4.1.3. Significance of Manufacturing
Manufacturing in Lanao del Sur is a small industry, and it is predominantly composed of backyard- or
home-based cottage industries ranging from food producers and micro- to small-based agri-based
processing. The Matling Industrial and Commercial Corporation, a large cassava starch producer
established in 1928 in Malabang, dominated the industry. Except for Matling Corporation, very few
products of the food- and agri-based manufacturing industry in Lanao del Sur have penetrated the
commercial market outside the province. The limited marketing opportunity of the processed foods and
cottage product discouraged the development of the industry. In many cases, the micro-scale cottage
industry is less permanent since people who engage in this kind of industry prefer to venture on other
more promising activities in terms of gains and profits.
Aside from food and agriculture-based processing, the province, notably the town of Tugaya,
manufactures cultural artefacts ranging from woodworks, brassware, and malong (traditional tubular
article of clothing). Other places like Marawi City have developed its cottage industries, thanks to the
rural-urban migration of residents and artisans. Like other industries in the province, production of
cultural material art are community enterprises. But middlemen in major cities in the country buy the
products from the artisans at low price, and they sell the products at huge profit margins in major markets
across the country.
Achieving economies of scale in manufacturing is a challenge in Lanao del Sur. Many have yet to learn the
proper standardization of products, phyto-sanitary requirements, processing, sustainable packaging, and
marketing. Little to no industry and academe collaboration to elevate production to high value addition
exists. Product development is limited, leaving no room for value creation. Many micro producers have
limited access to the right mix of capital and technology to increase their scale and market penetration.
There are many attempts in business matching in the past, but its efficacy has been muted because of
limited capacity of local manufacturers to produce products with consistent quality.
Insufficient infrastructures such as power, water system, solid waste management, reliable transportation
and communication system, and peace and security situation are the main stumbling blocks of the
province to attract medium-sized and large manufacturers. The Matling Corporation compensated the
infrastructure gap by constructing its own sea and air ports and power supply.
Meanwhile, producers in neighboring provinces adopted some products that are traditionally local to
Lanao del Sur and unique to the Mëranaw identity, and introduced them as their own in the commercial
Vision 2040

|

Lanao del Sur PDPFP

213

market. Little effort has been done to protect the local producers in Lanao del Sur, effectively reducing
the authenticity of Mëranaw products. Some producers outside Lanao del Sur even have developed
Mëranaw products but concocted them with materials or ingredients verging towards the realm of haram,
clouding the respect of commercial products to the culture and identity that initially gave birth to them.
Despite the challenges in the manufacturing sector, the province can develop industries related to the
products being produced by some of its manufacturers and farmers. For instance, bio-ethanol production
is a promising venture as this could be sourced out from cassava and sugarcane which are some of the
top commodities in the province.

4.1.4. Significance of the Hospitality or Tourism Industry
The tourism industry has a tremendous potential not only as income earner for the province, but also as
a platform to showcase its long and colorful history, its cultural and ecological assets, as well as the
hospitality of its residents.
The province as a whole can be said to be an ideal tourist destination. It sits on high elevation making its
climate temperate amidst heavily forested and mountainous landscape. It boasts the beautiful Lake Lanao
and other smaller lakes, rivers, waterfalls, underground water, springs, and sea coasts. Other points of
interests are the four islets in Lake Lanao, geologic rock formations, rolling hills, and the famous mountain
resembling the “Sleeping Beauty”. Many of them are yet to be explored providing the best thrill for the
adventurous. [Refer to Table 49]
Lake Lanao is a scenic place where beautiful mosques are scattered along the coasts like shimmering gems
as if they emerge from the crystal blue waters. The torogan are traditional royal houses adorned with
wood carvings, an architectural heritage of the Mëranaws, which can be found in few places across the
province. The town of Tugaya is recognized cultural site where artisans still practice their craft and live
their traditions, producing some the most exquisite brass wares, wood carvings, and handwoven cloth. In
addition, the tumultuous period of resistance of the locals against the Spanish, American and Japanese
colonial campaigns left some indelible marks in the form of historical sites and functional infrastructures
in different parts of the province. [Refer to Table 50]
Aside from the tangibles, there are many aspects of cultural traditions from the authentic Mëranaws food
escapade to traditional sports, music, events (pakaradya-an), enthronement, etc. that will enthrall both
the residents and visitors.

However, constraints to tourism growth in the province include security concerns, lack of travel advisories
and information, absence of integrated transportation, inadequate accommodation, limited involvement
of investors in the tourism industry, unpreparedness of city/municipal government units, inadequate
resources and funding, and significant gaps in tourist-friendly infrastructures.
There are hosts of opportunities for the expansion of the province’s share of the domestic and
international tourism market. This requires intra-government and public-private cooperation and
partnership. Drafting a master plan on tourism development of the province which will include the
identification of funding source and mutually beneficial public sector-private sector partnerships will be a
first step to achieving the desired goal of a vibrant tourism industry in Lanao del Sur.
The prospects for tourism is huge. Tourist arrivals between 2008 and 2018 had a positive trend. In 2018
alone, about 102,935 tourists visited Lanao del Sur which brought an estimated 1.8 billion pesos to the
local economy. [Refer to Table 51,Table 52, and Figure 14]

To sustain the gains, the province LGU through the Provincial Tourism, Culture and the Arts undertook the
following major programs to strengthen the tourism industry. These include:
•

Develop and Market Competitive Products and Establishments. Initial listings of Provincial
Tourism Products and Services were updated regularly to provide support for festivals, travel
marts and fairs. The latter serves as a market venue for tourism products, souvenir items, and
possible investment ventures.

•

Improve Market Access, Connectivity and Destination Infrastructure. The Province Tourism,
Culture and Arts (PTCA) assisted the municipal LGUs and facilitated the finalization and submission
of LGU-initiated project proposals for infrastructure development, including package proposal for
the cultural mapping of the province; and

•

Improve Tourism Institutional Governance and Human Resources. This follows through the
implementation of the requirements set out by the DILG for the creation of the position of
municipal tourism officer. Homestay facilitation were conducted to LGU tourism officers, prime
movers, tourism councils, and other stake holders. The program also strengthened linkages
through the participation of tourism officers to various national tourism meetings, conventions,
and activities. The program learned to use benchmarks consisting of best tourism practices of
other provinces and applied them to Lanao del Sur LGU. Further, the program has supported the
municipal LGU tourism offices, as well as tourism-related groups and activities, on a regular basis.
The program highlights the contribution of tourism value chain. It has encouraged the LGUs and
private sectors in Lanao del Sur to actively participate in promoting tourism assets. These are
achieved through institutionalized linkages (leveraging on built social assets, both in the public
and private sectors) to stimulate investment interests, generate travel, and encourage people
empowerment livelihood projects to promote business tourism in the development areas
particularly in the remote towns. Moreover, the unit has continued to utilize its promotion and
marketing partners in their respective areas to facilitate, and to create a wider range of effective
delivery of tourism services. The office constantly monitors tourism activities to keep the
personnel and staff, and partners-on-the-ground abreast on tourism development and strategies,
on a regular basis.

•

Tourism Development and Promotion Services. This covers promotion and marketing of Lanao
del Sur’s rich and preserved cultural, historical, and ecotourism places as places of attraction for
residents and visitors alike. Further, the program seeks to generate economic opportunities for
the marginal stakeholders, celebration of cultural festivals, and participation to national and
international tourist expositions and travel marts. The Tourism Advocacy and Tourism Council
Organization aims to bring tourism development to the lower level and to effectively meet the
demand of consumers of tourism products and services.

4.1.5. Industry Orientation
The location quotient measures the province’s industrial specialization relative to a larger geographic unit,
in this case the aggrupation of economies of Lanao del Sur and its immediate neighbors. The location
quotient is computed based on the standard formula established in international trade and industrial
organization literature. Based on the 2018 PSA data on list of establishments, Lanao del Sur has high
relative concentration of four industries: mining (mainly sand and pebble quarrying); education;
agriculture, fishing, and forestry; and trade. Their location quotients are greater than 1. [Refer to Figure

4.2.1. Crop Production
4.2.1.1. Rice
Rice is the major agricultural product in the province cultivated in almost all the municipalities, but in
smaller areas in the coastal part. [Refer to Map 47] The present area devoted to rice by ecological zone
are as follows: irrigated (7,080 hectares), rainfed lowland (23,926 hectares), and rainfed upland (5,018
hectares). Both irrigated and rainfed lowland rice production are pursued in two cropping seasons.
Rainfed upland only have one cropping season and sometimes seasonal. [Refer to Table 54]

Rice industry performance in Lanao del Sur for the last five years experienced a declining trend, owing to
climate variability, poor irrigation facilities, land conversion, and low-level fertilizer application by farmers.
The average yield is placed at 2.6 MT per hectare for rainfed lowland rice, 3.5 MT per hectare for irrigated
rice variety, and 2.2 MT per hectare for upland rice, bringing the average yield to 2.77 MT per hectare for
combined rice varieties in 2019. [Refer to Figure 16]

4.2.1.2. Corn
Although considered a major contributor to the country’s corn supply, the area devoted to corn
production and its average yield decline. The expansion of banana plantation and production shift to
other crops such as sugarcane, cassava and rubber in Wao and Bumbaran (Amai Manabilang) contributed
to the reduction of corn production area and productivity. [Refer to Map 48]

Wao produces 99 percent of yellow corn and only one percent of white corn. Bumbaran (Amai
Manabilang) produces 85 percent of white corn production and 15 percent of yellow corn. Other
municipalities use Open Pollinated Variety of white corn as their planting materials. White corn harvest
for the last five years had an average yield of 2.2 MT per hectare, while yellow corn yielded 3.5 MT per
hectare. Their combined average yield rate was 2.75 MT per hectare, which was lower than the national
average of 3.5 MT per hectare. [Refer to Figure 17 and Table 56]
The province had a supply surplus of corn since it has low consumption of the commodity.

4.2.1.3. Abaca
Abaca production plays a vital part to the agriculture of Lanao Sur and Central Mindanao. Like many other
provinces in Mindanao, Lanao del Sur is also ideal for planting high value crops like abaca because of its
fertile agricultural lands and good climate condition.
The province is one of the top ten producers in the Philippines. The province has an average yield of 0.91
MT per hectare. Abaca is mostly grown in the upland areas particularly in Calanogas and the rest of
municipalities in the second district. Lanao del Sur is second to Sulu in abaca production in BARMM and
ranks number eight in the country. [Refer to Figure 18, Table 57, and Map 49]

4.2.1.4. Cassava
Cassava is cultivated in the coastal municipalities of Malabang, Balabagan, Kapatagan and some parts of
the Picong. [Refer to Map 50] The mere presence of the two big corporations—Matling Flour Milling
Corporation in Malabang and Itil Production, Inc. in Balabagan—is an indication that the volume of cassava
production is quite large that it can feed two milling companies. The cassava fresh tubers are marketed
locally even in Maguindanao, Iligan City and Cagayan de Oro as the dropping point. Due to lack of financial
and capability of farmers, the transfer of technology in processing cassava production is still low. Cassava
is also marketed locally by the farmers.
Cassava production output of the province of Lanao del Sur is very significant particularly in the coastal
areas and central Unayan town. The contribution of cassava is 80.32 percent in Central Mindanao gross
production. [Refer to Figure 19 and Table 58]

4.2.1.5. Coconut
Coconut is popularly known as the “Tree of Life” because of the variety of products and by-products made
from the tree namely: coconut meat, oil, juice, husk, shell, shell charcoal, leaves, husk, pith, inflorescence,
trunk and roots.
Coconut is another main source of income of the province particularly in municipalities along the coastal
areas where most plantations are concentrated. Coconut trees are also grown in the different upland
municipalities of the province but only for local consumption, unlike those in the coastal areas where
coconuts are sold in volume as copra. [Refer to Map 51]
There are 77,068 hectares of coconut land harvested in the whole province. These are mostly found in
Malabang, Balabagan, Picong, Marogong, and portion of Calanogas. The coconut products can be
transported through the seaports at Malabang and Picong. [Refer to Figure 20 and Table 59]
Unfortunately, productivity levels remain low and one of the reasons may be attributed to lack of
information on appropriate technologies for coconut farming.

4.2.1.8. Banana
The province of Lanao del Sur is a primary source of banana in ARMM. Banana of native variety is
abundant across the province. Bumbaran hosts the vast banana plantation in the province, and its produce
are exported to the middle east countries. The bananas produced in the province are distributed outside
the province in various drop points, notably in Marawi City and Malabang. [Refer to Map 54]
Lanao del Sur was the second largest banana producer province in ARMM, next to Maguindanao province.
The volume of production in the province is 65,046.8 MT in 2018. With 1,867.30 hectares devoted to
banana production, the average yield of Lanao del Sur was 36.04 MT per hectare. [Refer to Table 62]

4.2.1.9. Rubber
The rubber industry is expected to contribute significantly to inclusive growth as rubber is 85 percent
dominated by small farmers. Some of advantages of rubber production include: 1) it is easy to grow and
manage, 2) it requires minimal tillage, and 3) a rubber tree has an average of 25 to 30 years’ productive
life. It is estimated that natural rubber sequesters about three to five tons of carbon per hectare per year,
of which two-thirds remain in the soil (not taking into account the carbon balance from changes in land
use). Sequestration can be significantly increased through multi-cropping of rubber with other crops such
as coffee.
The main drawback of rubber trees, being a non-native plant species, is that it sucks up tremendous
amount of the water table.
Lanao del Sur is considerably a new entrant to rubber farming. [Refer to Map 55] Within the last five
years, about three municipalities planted rubber, corresponding to an area of 1,522 hectares. Of which
about 976 hectares have mature rubber trees that are tappable. Rubber trees planted to date increased
from 1,544 hectares in 2013 to 1,666 hectares in 2017. [Refer to Table 63]

4.2.1.10. Sugarcane
Lanao del Sur was the number one producer of sugarcane production in the region in 2017. Its volume of
production was 109,881.60 MT, which was three times higher than the production of all other provinces
in the ARMM. [Refer to Figure 25] Production is confined in Wao and Bumbaran (Amai Manabilang). [Refer
to Map 56]
Aside from its use as inputs in the food and beverage industry, sugar cane has a lucrative potential in the
chemical or pharmaceutical industry. The demand for bioethanol in the domestic and international
markets is high and will further rise as the government mandates the increase in the blend of bio-ethanol
with all gasoline sold domestically.

4.2.1.11. Other Crops
Aside from the traditional crops, the province produced native fruits such as durian, lanzones, jackfruit,
as well as a range of vegetables.
The locals are huge consumers of exotic or native fruits, and, yet, the volume of production is less than
ideal. [Refer to Table 65] The province have to import exotic fruits and vegetables from Iligan and Cagayan
de Oro City.
The terroir of the province is suitable for planting of exotic or native fruit-bearing trees, and can even rival
other provinces in Region 11 (Davao) and Region 12 (SOCCSKSARGEN). The province can develop an array
of manufactured products from native fruits and vegetables.

4.2.2. Livestock
Lanao del Sur is endowed with natural resources conducive to livestock and poultry raising. It has a Type
4 climatic condition characterized by evenly distributed rainfall throughout the year. It has hilly to slightly
rolling topography that can be of great potential for forage and pasture development, and has abundant
supply of water that can be used for sanitation of livestock and poultry houses. It has hardworking human
resources reliable to ensure the success of livestock and poultry ventures.
Despite these, local residents depend on the nearby provinces, like Bukidnon and Misamis Oriental for its
livestock and poultry needs. The volume of local production is not enough to meet the demand.

4.3. Cooperatives and Association
Lanao del Sur has a fair share of people-centered organizations and enterprises, in the form of
cooperatives, as well as farmers’ associations and clubs, many of whose members are rural farmers and
those at the margin of the economy in the informal sector.
By organizing themselves into cooperatives and associations, small farmers and those employed in the
informal sector are able to access credit, supply inputs, and markets. Access would otherwise have been
difficult for the farmers and self-employed workers given the market failures in any agrarian or rural
economies and the informal markets and the competition they face with medium-sized and large
businesses.
A total of 628 cooperatives, 115 farmers’ associations, 51 multi-purpose cooperatives under the Rural
Improvements Club program, 21 4-H Clubs, and 14 irrigators’ association are registered in Lanao del Sur.
Some of them, however, are not fully functional. [Refer to Table 71 and Table 72]

4.4. Human Resource
4.4.1. Population of Gainful Workers
The quality of the human resource determines the level of economic development of Lanao del Sur. This
is borne out largely by the role of the abled, educated, and skilled population in facilitating prospects for
innovation and entrepreneurship in any nook of the economy. A high general level of human capital
provides a leverage for population to manage the utilization of available and limited resources for better
use, but also it creates a positive externality through improvements in current and future earnings, labor
force participation, total factor productivity, and the feedback loop of knowledge-sharing and innovation
to skill accumulation and economic growth. Hence, the development of the human resource is crucial for
the formation and expansion of the human capital of the province. The status of the human resource
development or the human capital asset will be tackled extensively in the chapter on social sector.
Lanao del Sur had about 294,673 working population who are 15 years old and above, as of 2015. They
represented 28.2 percent of the total population of 1,045,429. As expected, many of them (a fifth of the
total) resided in Marawi City, being the province’s growth center where the population gravitate towards
to for employment and other economic opportunities. [Refer to Figure 26]
A significant number of the gainful workers were young adults to middle age, i.e. between 25 to 39 years
old.

About four gainful workers were females for every 10 gainful workers in Lanao del Sur in 2015. Only
Marawi City and the four municipalities of Tugaya, Bayang, Buadiposo-Buntong, and Madalum had a
relatively high proportion of females in the gainful worker population. Tugaya had almost 7 female gainful
workers for every 10 male gainful workers. Marawi and the three other municipalities had at least five
female gainful workers for every 10 male workers. [Refer to Figure 27 and Figure 28]

Among the gainful workers in the province in 2015, about 42.3 percent of them were skilled agricultural
and fishery workers. Sultan Dumalondong had the highest number of skilled agriculture and fisher workers
at 81 percent of its municipal population of gainful workers. Calanogas, Piagapo, Pagayawan, LumbacaUnayan, Pualas, Tubaran, Tagoloan II, Butig, Kapatagan, Picong (Sultan Gumander), Marogong, Kapai,
Lumbatan, Balabagan, Madamba, Lumba-Bayabao, Madalum, Lumbayanague, Bumbaran (Amai
Manabilang), Maguing, and Mulondo had more than half of its gainful worker population were skilled
agriculture and fishery workers. All other municipalities had more than a third to almost half of their
respective municipal gainful worker population were skilled in agriculture and fishery except for Marawi
City and Tugaya which had 12.7 percent and 14.5 percent, respectively, were skilled in the field.

Next to agriculture and fishery workers, about 18.1 percent of gainful working population in the province
were managers which is characteristically unsurprising among the locals who are known traders and
business owners. Topping them was Bubong where 31.5 percent of its municipal working population were
managers, followed by Tamparan (27.6 percent), Taraka (27.1 percent), Balindong or Watu (26.7 percent),
Marawi City (26.2 percent), Bacolod Kalawi or Bacolod Grande (25.3 percent), Bayang (25 percent),
Binidayan (24.8 percent), and Tugaya (24.2 percent). Bumbaran, Kapatagan, and Wao had the least share
of managers at 5.2 percent, 5.3 percent, and 5.8 percent, respectively.
The province had a combined 20.8 percent of its total gainful worker population either as professionals,
technicians, craft and trade workers, or as plan and machine operators. These class of worker population
will be essential as the province embarks to expand its modern agriculture-based economy in the next 20
years. Leading the municipalities is Tugaya owing the large number of crafts and trade workers. Bacolod
Kalawi (Bacolod Grande) and Marawi City followed at 31.6 percent, and 30.4 percent of their respective
municipal gainful worker population. The municipalities of Marantao, Saguiaran, Ditsaan-Ramain,
Ganassi, Poona Bayabao, Balindong or Watu, Masiu, Bayang, Maguing, Malabang, and BuadiposoBuntong had a fifth to more than a quarter of their respective gainful worker population as either
professionals, technicians, crafts and trade workers, or plant and machine operators. [Refer to Figure 29]
While only a little more than a quarter of the gainful worker population in 2015 were females, the latter
dominate the professionals (78.1 percent). Females occupied a significant share of gainful workers who
were service and sales workers (50.7 percent), managers (47.4 percent), technicians (46.1 percent),
clerical workers (40.4 percent), craft and trade workers (39.8 percent). [Refer to Figure 30]

Within Lanao del Sur, there were more literate females household population (352,556 persons), who
were 10 years old and above, than their male counterpart (331,938 persons). This means that, for every
100 literate males, there were 106 literate females. In fact, more females were more literate from age 10
years old to 44 years old. Beyond that age range, male literacy rate dominated over female literacy rate.
[Refer to Figure 32]
Tugaya, Wao, and Ganassi were the top three municipalities in Lanao del Sur with the highest literacy rate
in 2015: 99.2 percent, 98.4 percent, and 98.3 percent. In fact, they ranked at least as high as the national
average of 98.3 percent. Ten municipalities had the lowest literacy rates for the same year were:
Kapatagan (80.9 percent), Calanogas (82.8 percent), Sultan Dumalondong (83 percent), Picong or Sultan
Gumander (84.8 percent), Marogong (85.3 percent), Pualas (86.9 percent), Tagoloan II (87.2 percent),
Tubaran (87.3 percent), Malabang (88 percent), and Bumbaran (88.7 percent). These ten municipalities
had literacy rates at least as low as the regional average of the former ARMM of 88.7 percent. [Refer to
Figure 33]
The younger household population were more literate, in general, than their older counterpart in 2015.

4.4.3. Highest Educational Attainment of Household Population
Global studies have shown the importance of educational attainment which tends to monotonically
increase the economic and social returns to education initially at an increasing rate, but tapers off as one
climbs up further the educational ladder.41 This is probably the reason why Lanao del Sur like other
provinces in BARMM has focused on basic education as a development priority, and is rooted in the
neoclassical growth theory where education is an input to labor and exogenously determined in the
growth process. About 72.6 percent of household population who were five years old and above in Lanao
del Sur had anywhere between pre-school and post-secondary graduate as their highest educational
attainment in 2015. The National Capital Region’s (NCR) average was 63.4 percent, many of them going
towards higher education.
However, this observation belies the fact that education confers a multiplier contribution to growth where
education (hence, technology) is endogenously determined in the economic growth equation. Higher level
of education creates a feedback loop to total factor productivity, and the spillover effects of education
reinforces greater knowledge and technology sharing, as well as faster innovation, and better utilization
and management of resources, both at the firm level and province level. At the same time, the social
benefits of higher educational attainment are innumerable. Many studies have shown that it tends to
increase maternal and child health outcomes, reduce urban crimes, improves women empowerment, and
the general level and rate of long-term productivity. Higher education in this sense has increasing returns
to economic production and a critical variable to development.
Compared to other provinces in the former ARMM in 2015, Lanao del Sur like Tawi-tawi had the highest
share of population who were at least college undergraduate as their highest level of educational
attainment at 15.6 percent each. However, Lanao del Sur pales in comparison to NCR’s average of 34.3
percent in the same year. [Refer to Figure 35]
About 5.5 percent of Lanao del Sur’s population were at least academic degree holders, second to TawiTawi (6.3 percent). NCR’s share was 18.6 percent. Further, only 0.1 percent of the Lanao del Sur
population went on for postbaccalaureate (masters or PhD) studies like Tawi-Tawi. The NCR’s average was
0.2 percent.
If this pattern of higher education outcomes were to continue in the next 20 years or so, Lanao del Sur
will have difficulty in modernizing its economy and to leapfrog to higher economic growth trajectory.
Education has greater role in expanding the capacity of the economy to generate new ideas and
technologies, as well as in facilitating the application of innovative ideas and technologies to modern day
challenges of the province. Higher education tends to amplify these effects. A highly educated workforce

41

Refer to various studies on economic of education and on labor economics extensively investigated by Kingdon
(2017), Sharada and Knight (2000), Card (2001), Krueger and Lindahl (2001), etc.

264

who will become professionals and specialists, will be suited in managing and running various economic
organizations of production. The educated workforce have roles in the ensuring the productivity of
businesses including those in the agriculture and in expanding the micro and small enterprises to highly

Despite the educational attainment outcomes, the province still has a huge education gap. About 11.1
percent (about 98,624 persons) of its population five years old and above had no formal schooling and
whatsoever, as of 2015, compared to NCR average of 1.8 percent.
The top 10 municipalities in Lanao del Sur with the highest share of household population five years old
and above with no formal education in 2015 were: Tubaran (24.4 percent), Calanogas (22.6 percent),
Sultan Dumalondong (21.2 percent), Kapatagan ( 20.8 percent), Marogong (20.2 percent), Picong or Sultan
Gumander (19.7 percent), Tagoloan II (18.2 percent), Bumbaran (17.7 percent), Pagayawan or Tatarikan
(17.4 percent), and Butig (17 percent). The average for the NCR was 1.8 percent; Lanao del Sur, 11.1
percent; and the former ARMM, 14.2 percent. [Refer to Figure 37]

Chapter 5: Social Services

K

ey to understanding the social sector in Lanao del Sur is it adopts both the human resource
development and human development approaches. The first emphasizes the investments in
education, health and nutrition, welfare of the vulnerable groups, and shelter as a means of
expanding the human capital of the province. In large part, it explains the relative high number of social
sector facilities, particularly education, in Lanao del Sur, which alludes to the need to spread the enabling
factors to increase the likelihood of the residents to participate in the development process. The second
encompasses “enlargement of choices” through empowerment and equity in basic capabilities. The
quality of social sector services has a vital role in influencing the future capabilities of the residents in
Lanao del Sur.
As it currently stands, access to quality services remain a challenge in the province.

5.1. Housing
5.1.1. Demand for Housing
There are many factors that drive up the demand for housing and housing ownership in Lanao del Sur in
the recent years. These include the population expansion and changes in the demographic structures,
higher incomes, and the destruction of Marawi City in 2018. There are also factors that stifle the demand
for housing ownership such as high cost of borrowings, limited access to credit, unclear property rights
and convoluted land markets, cheap property rents, among others.
For the past few years, the rise in average incomes in the province owed it to improved business activities
in many parts of the province as well as the cyclical migration of professionals and non-professionals
working abroad, not discounting the economic interruptions of the global pandemic beginning 2020. The
increase in incomes and wealth allowed individuals or households to spend on quality homes.
Lanao del Sur had a strong population growth. A total of 16,346 households were added to the household
stock in Lanao del Sur in just a span of five years from 2010 to 2015, with Marawi City having the largest
increase (2,178) followed by Malabang (849), Marantao (677, Masiu (521), and Piagapo (499). [Refer to
Table 73]
While the average household size in the province remained at 6.5, a total of 20 municipalities led by Pualas
and Kapatagan experienced an increase in average household size. An increase in average household size
drives the demand for housing for a given population. About 12 municipalities including Marawi City had
no change in household size between 2010 and 2015, and only eight municipalities had a decline in
household size led by Sultan Dumalondong, followed by Tugaya and Tagoloan II. [Refer to Table 74]

268

The destruction of the urban core of Marawi City which displaced at least 9,676 households according to
the PSA in 2015, raises the demand for permanent housing once the residents return.
High rural-urban migration within Lanao del Sur propped up by the increasing prospects of urbanization
will have a positive influence on the demand for housing in urban and peri-urban towns particularly the
proposed Metropolitan Marawi as well as the secondary growth areas like Malabang, Wao, and
Tamparan.
The increase in the demand for housing will put pressure on house prices in the property market. This
trend will likely be exacerbated because of the growing patterns of local preference to acquire properties
and to build houses along major highways. This spatial arrangement makes the housing market tight, not
to mention the unclear property rights regime governing the land market in Lanao del Sur.

In terms of building types of occupied housing structures, about 99,932 units or 82.3 percent of total in
the province were single houses. The rest were duplexes (11,924 units or 9.8 percent), multi-unit
residential houses (9,234 units or 7.6 percent), while commercial buildings (195 units), institutional living
quarters (9 units), and other types (26 units) have less than one percent share of the total. [Refer to Figure
38]
Taraka, followed by Binidayan, Tugaya, Balindong (Watu), and Tamparan, had the highest number of
multi-unit residential housing units largely because of the local traditions of multiple households living
under one roof.
The construction materials of housing structures greatly say about the wealth and comfort of households
and the availability of former considering the costs required to transport bulky quality materials from
Iligan City and Cagayan de Oro City.
Most (83.3 percent) of the occupied dwelling units in Lanao del Sur as of 2015 had roof made of galvanized
iron being the relatively cheap and sturdy construction material. Only 6.1 percent had roofs made of
concrete and 5.3 percent a combination of concrete and galvanized iron. Some households who did not
have the means contented themselves by using traditional materials like bamboo and nipa, or scrap
materials and trapal as roof. There were 5,234 housing units that use those materials as roofs, and they
comprise 4.3 percent of total. Further, about 888 housing units in the province used asbestos as roof,
which is dangerous to health. [Refer to Figure 39]
In terms of absolute magnitude, the housing units with roofs made of light materials (nipa, bamboo,
salvaged materials, and trapal) were concentrated in Marawi City (706 houses), Picong or Sultan
Gumander (461 houses), Madalum (418 houses), and Malabang (378 houses). However, in relative terms,
the municipalities with highest percent share of dwelling units with roof made of light materials were:
Tubaran, Picong (Sultan Gumander), Madamba, Madalum, and Bacolod Kalawi (Bacolod Grande) having
20.8 percent, 19.7 percent, 14.3 percent, 12.5 percent, and 10.5 percent of their respective total number
of occupied housing units.

For the same year, more than half (52.1 percent) of occupied housing units in Lanao del Sur had outer
walls made of wood, only a quarter (26.8 percent) were made of concrete, and more than a tenth (12.5
percent) a combination of concrete and wood. About 6.7 percent (or 8,122 units) of the total occupied
houses have outer walls constructed using light or flimsy materials such as bamboo or nipa, salvaged
materials, and trapal. Further, 27 housing units had no outer walls.
The top ten municipalities with highest share of dwelling units whose outer walls were made of light
materials were Bacolod Kalawi or Bacolod Grande (27.7 percent), Calanogas (23 percent), Madalum (21
percent), Tubaran (20.5 percent), Pagayawan or Tatarikan (17.2 percent), Picong or Sultan Gumander
(14.6 percent), Madamba (14.1 percent), Ganassi (10.5 percent), Kapatagan (10.4 percent), and Piagapo

Home ownership provides long-term stability and stronger ties of households to their communities.
Owning a residential property was the significant house tenure arrangements in Lanao del Sur in 2015.
Three-quarters (75.3 percent) of households own or have owner-like possession of house and lot in the
province. About 12.6 percent of total household own their houses on a lot they did not own but paid no
rent with consent from the lot owners. Another 6.4 percent of total households live in a rent-free house
and lot with consent of the owners. Households who rented properties constitute: 2.3 percent (rent
house or room including lot), 1.9 percent (own house and rent lot). About 1.4 percent which comprised
2,244 households in the province resided in a property where they either owned the house on a lot free
of rent without consent of the owners or they had not paid rent on both house and lot without consent
of the owners. In either case, households of such types were also called squatters. [Refer to Figure 41]
Sultan Dumalondong had the highest share (25.1 percent) of households residing on a property (either
or both house and lot) without the consent of the owners. It is followed by Kapatagan (10.6 percent),
Madalum (4.6 percent), Balabagan and Saguairan (3.4 percent each), Tamparan (2.2 percent), Pagayawan
and Bacolod Kalawi (1.7 percent each), Marawi City (1.4 percent), and Wao (1.3 percent).

5.1.2. Housing Supply
Lanao del Sur has limited number of socialized housing programs and projects, houses and lots, that were
undertaken by the government.
The first socialized housing program implemented in Lanao del Sur during the Marcos administration was
the BLISS program after the issuance of EO No. 517 series of January 9, 1979, entitled “Adopting the
Bagong Lipunan Sites and Services Program as a Development Strategy.” The program had a national scale.
The strategy adopted by the central government during the martial law years was to achieve an equitable
distribution of socio-economic opportunities in the country to, among others, curb the alarming inmigration rate. Furthermore, it was projected to bring development settlements to surrounding
communities and illustrate the benefits of human settlements which was anticipated as an approach to
community building.
Marawi City (particularly in Barangay Caiogan-Papandayan), Binidayan (Barangay Pagalamatan),
Saguiaran, Bumbaran, and Masiu were the first recipients of the national socialized housing program.
Almost two decades later, another socialized housing program under the Estrada administration was
implemented in Kapatagan.
Few local leaders from the ARMM rolled out their housing programs in Barangay Maliwanag, Municipality
of Bayang for MNLF rebel returnees.
Various housing programs mushroomed at the outskirts of Marawi City after the 2017 fall of the city. All
of the former residents of the 24 barangays within the urban core of Marawi, now referred to as the most
affected areas, have seen their homes destroyed. Aside from the socialized housing program of ARMMBRIDGE in Saguiaran, national agencies and donors helped construct temporary and permanent shelters
far from the urban center. [Refer to Table 77 and Table 78]

5.2. Education
The benefits of education is substantial. At the micro level, education is associated with improvements in
individual productivity and income, measured by returns to schooling, after controlling for intrinsic
individual ability, with variations according to the level of development of the country or provinces.42
Aside from benefits that accrue to the individual, education generates social benefits. Some studies have
established the pathways of education to better health outcomes. Improvements in literacy, numeracy,
and general level of comprehension increase maternal and child health. Maternal education is associated
with a wide range of preventive and treatment-oriented health behaviors.43 Other studies have
established that better education empowers women and the voiceless. At the macro level, an increase in
average education by one year results in an increase general measure of economic development such as
GDP per capita by about three to six percent, with tertiary education being most important in raising
aggregate productivity, economic growth, and general levels of income.44 Investments in human capital
(i.e. higher level of education and health status of the population stock) also generates positive
externalities that are often embodied in increased adoption of technology, with favorable feedback loop
on raising the total factor productivity of the economy.45
Lanao del Sur has come a long way in terms of massive investments in education over the years. It is safe
to claim that education in the province benefited a large number of individuals and communities.
However, many have observed that Lanao del Sur has yet to see how education is to translate into high

local economic growth and aggregate productivity. This is in the context of many of the educated
Mëranaws prefer to migrate to other areas of the country and abroad, where they earn more. Efforts to
encourage them to return to the province and to start rebuilding the local economy like many of the newly
industrialized countries have done were in vain. Others claim that the province has overinvested in
quantity rather than quality of education.
Compared to other parts of the country, Lanao del Sur came in late in terms of educating its constituents
through the formal education setup. Up until the mid-20th century, Mëranaws were wary about sending
their children to school over fears of the negative influence of modern Western values.
At present, education is regarded as the most potent catalyst for emancipation from ignorance that
breeds poverty and social isolation in a world of rapid change. Lanao del Sur prides itself with the number
of public and private education institutions, mostly in Marawi City.
To widen access to education, the Department of Education of ARMM, which is now the Ministry of Basic,
Higher, and Technical Education of BARMM, (DepEd/MBHTE) demarcated school administration for basic
education (elementary and secondary levels) into three school divisions: Lanao del Sur-I, Lanao del Sur-II,
and Marawi City. [Refer to Map 57]

5.2.1. Education Access
Many factors affect access to education in Lanao del Sur. Chief among them is the availability of school
facilities in the communities and the transportation cost of students going to school. Household income,
children’s interest and family support to the education of children are important variables. However, the
passage the universal education acts and laws that provide free education (e.g. Free Secondary Education
Act, the Equitable Access Act, and the Government Assistance to Students and Teachers in Private
Education Act) makes income less of a binding constraint to access to, at least, basic education.
5.2.1.1. Elementary Education
Lanao del Sur had 1,181 schools that offer elementary education, as of the school year (SY) 2020 to 2021.
About 47.2 percent (or 557 units) of total elementary schools were in Lanao del Sur-I Division, 45.3 percent
(or 535 elementary schools) in Lanao del Sur-II Division, and 7.5 percent (89 elementary schools) in Marawi
City Division. Of the total 1,181 elementary schools, majority or 722 were public schools and 459 were
private schools. [Refer to Figure 42]
About 42 percent of the total number of elementary schools (both public and private) were in the ten
municipalities including the capital. Marawi City had the highest number (89) of elementary schools, both
public and private, followed by Piagapo (62), Masiu (58), Marogong (47), Marantao (46), Lumba Bayabao
(42), Saguiaran (40), Balindong (38), Malabang (38), and Wao (37).
However, all of them except Marogong and Saguiaran were among the top 10 municipalities and city with
the highest elementary school-aged (aged six to 11 years old) population in 2020. Tamparan and Maguing
were ranked 8th and 10th in terms of population size among six to 11 years old, but they have only 16 and
28 elementary schools, public and private, respectively. In fact, aside from Tamparan and Maguing, other
municipalities like Tugaya, Binidayan, Mulondo, and Buadiposo-Buntong where the demand for
elementary education is high, exhibited by high magnitude of school-age population, had relatively low
number of elementary schools.

This created a disparity in terms of access, where the demand for school is high relative to the supply
capacity of the province. About 16 municipalities had population-to-elementary school ratio higher than
the average for the province of 175.5 persons (6 to 11 years old) per school. Leading them is Marawi City
at 420.7 school-age persons per elementary school, followed by Tamparan, Buadiposo-Buntong,
Binidayan, Malabang, Mulondo, Wao, Calanogas, Tugaya, Lumba Bayabao, Madalum, Maguing, Tubaran,

284

Kapai, Ditsaan-Ramain, and Madamba. In contrast, Piagapo, Kapatagan, Marogong, Masiu, and
Lumbayanague had the least ratio suggest the demand for access to access is sufficient or more than what
is required. [Refer to Table 79]

5.2.1.3. Higher Education
Lanao del Sur recognizes the role of higher education as a prime vehicle to improve the economic and
social conditions of the residents. The province has the most number of higher educational institutions
among the five BARMM provinces. Currently, the MBHTE/Commission on Higher Education (CHED)
accredited 53 higher education institutions (HEIs) composed of 47 private HEIs, three state universities
and colleges, and three CHED-supervised institutions. [Refer to Figure 44]
The presence of the Mindanao State University-Marawi Campus speaks of the growing Muslim
participation in post-secondary education, giving young Mëranaws chances to pursue college since only
a few can afford to enroll in private schools.

5.2.1.4. Technical and Vocational Education
Lanao del Sur is committed to broaden and deepen the welfare and economic concerns of the youth, and
to upskill the future workforce of the province. The policy shift in the educational policy towards schoolbased vocational education through the K-12 program at the national scale has benefited the province
given high unemployment rate among the youth and evolving demands for specialized skills to jumpstart
the economy.
The province does not have any TESDA Training Center although a structure has been proposed by TESDA
national office in the on-going Marawi rehabilitation efforts.
There about 46 TESDA-accredited technical and vocational education and training (TVET) providers in
Lanao del Sur offering 130 TVET programs, as of 2019. The province has 12 competency assessors and
four competency assessment centers. [Refer to Figure 45]

5.2.1.5. Madrasah
The importance of madrasah education in bringing forth the expansion of education services regardless
of one’s background was recognized by the Department of Education through the issuance of DepED
Order No. 51, Series of 2004 and ARMM-DepED Executive Order No. 13, Series of 2004. It established the
pathways by which the secular education and madrasah education are integrated in the curricula. Arabic
Language and Islamic Values are subjects offered in public schools that have Muslim students, at the same
time, English, Mathematics, Science, and Makabayan are included in the curriculum of private madaris.
Lanao del Sur had 444 madaris in the province, constituting 24 percent of the total in Mindanao, according
to a 2010 report of the Institute for Autonomy and Governance. Madaris are schools that teach Islamic
theology and subjects using Arabic. Not all of the madaris cited by the report were registered with the ARMMDepEd. [Refer to Table 81]

5.2.1.6. Alternative Learning System
The DepEd/MBHTE designed the Alternative Learning System, in response to the call for universal
education, which provides opportunities for out-of-school children and youth, as well as adults, to become
functionally literate through education programs that may be delivered outside the formal school system.
School dropouts are given the opportunity to complete elementary and secondary education outside of
the formal school system.
According to the 2015 national census, a total of 98,624 persons who were at least five years old in Lanao
del Sur had no formal education. They comprised 11.1 percent of total population of the province within
the age range. Out of the total number of persons with no formal education, about 46,174 were out-ofschool children (five to 14 years old). About 16,399 were out-of-school youth (15 to 29 years old).47 The
out-of-school children and out-of-school youth comprised 15.8 percent and 5.6 percent of the
corresponding population within the two age ranges. [Refer to Table 83]
Tubaran (24.4 percent), Calanogas (22.6 percent), and Sultan Dumalondong (21.2 percent) had the highest
percent of population aged at least five years old who had no formal education to their respective total
population within the age range. Tagoloan II (31 percent), Marogong (27.7 percent), and Calanogas (27
percent) were the top three municipalities with high proportion of out-of-school children. Moreover,
Sultan Dumalondong (18.3 percent), Tubaran (17.8 percent), and Calanogas (12.4 percent) were the top
three municipalities with high proportion of out-of-school youth.

The Philippines defines youth as those whose age falls within the range of 15 to 30 years old (“The Youth in
Nation Building Act” or RA 8044). The 2015 PSA-CPH data obtained does lumped the population data for
population with no grade completed within the age range of 30 to 34 years old. Hence, the out-of-school youth
data presented in the table is constrained by the data available, i.e. youth group considers only those within the
age range of 15 to 29 years old, rather than 30 years old.

The DepEd/MBHTE implemented programs, projects, and services designed to reintegrate to the formal
school system a vast number of school-age children and youth who are out-of-school. Those who
completed the learning sessions will take the equivalency examinations. Once learners in the Alternative
Learning System (ALS) passed, they are qualified to enroll in secondary schools. Older cohort of learners
are given the opportunity to acquire and develop livelihood and life skills to become productive members
of their communities. Various donors supported the ALS program of the DepEd/MBHTE, and some of them
are rolled out in Lanao del Sur.

5.2.1.7. Daytime Care Learning
Children below six years old receive daytime care learning supervised by Ministry of Social Services and
Development. As of 2018, out of 1,159 barangays in Lanao del Sur, 855 had daytime care centers or child
development centers. The province had the lowest coverage rate at 73.8 percent of day care centers
relative to its total number of barangays compared to other areas in the region—some with more than
one daytime care center per barangay, e.g. Maguindanao and Tawi-Tawi. [Refer to Table 84]

5.2.2. Education Outcomes
5.2.2.1. School Enrolment
Although Lanao del Sur had the large number of enrollees in both elementary and secondary public
schools in the entire region, the number of enrollees declined compared to the previous years, owing to
the ARMM-DepEd crackdown of “ghost” schools in an attempt to curb corruption that proliferated in the
education sector across the region.
In SY 2017-2018, Lanao del Sur had the second highest combined number of enrollees at 176,428
(consisting of 101,850 students in Lanao del Sur-I, 71,548 students in Lanao del Sur-II, and 3,0026 in
Marawi City), next to Maguindanao. [Refer to Table 85]
In contrast in public secondary schools for the same academic year, Lanao del Sur had the most number
of enrollees at a combined figure of 71,163 students (comprised of 38,954 in Lanao del Sur-I, 32,091 in
Lanao del Sur-II, and 118 in Marawi City). [Refer to Table 86]
The displacement of population and the destruction of schools (mainly in the urban core) of Marawi City
during the 2017 siege explains the sudden decline in the Marawi enrolment rate at elementary and
secondary levels.

5.2.2.2. School Dropout and Early School Leavers
The issue of education quality has never been more pronounced than in Lanao del Sur where
improvements in access to education has not translated to better standards exhibited by low education
outcomes and student performance.
Lanao del Sur witnessed an increasing number of student dropouts across the three school divisions. The
province’s share to the region’s total student dropouts at public elementary schools was lower than the
figures in SY 2013 to 2014, but it picked up in succeeding years. Dropout rates refer to students who
withdrew from completing a course of instruction relative to the total number of students in the cohort.
[Refer to Table 87]
Majority of the student dropouts in the province in the recent year were males. The latter comprised 53.5
percent of total school dropouts in public elementary schools in SY 2017-2018. [Refer to Table 88]

but only to pick up thereafter. The province accounted for 44.2 percent (or a combined total of 2,385
students) of the total dropouts in the former ARMM in 2016-2017. [Refer to Table 89]
About 51.8 percent of the total school dropouts in Lanao del Sur in public secondary schools in SY 20172018 were males. [Refer to Table 90]

School leaver rate is a general measure for dropout rate. It covers both students who did not finish a
particular grade or year level as well as those who finished but failed to enroll in the next grade or year
level the following school year.
A number of reasons explain why students were forced to leave schools in the past academic years from
individual- and household-specific reasons (such as income, preference, general interest, voluntary
migration of families) to community-level factors. The significant driver of students dropping out or

leaving schools in the province was related to incidents of rido (or family feud) involving neighbors that
disrupt the general level of security of the community, or of the family when one member of the
household is directly involved in a rido. Other security threats include the presence of local armed and
terrorist groups that led to the skirmishes in different parts of the country, and much recently in 2017,
the siege in Marawi, which saw the untold casualties and decimation of properties including schools, as
well as massive displacement of families.
Compared to other provinces in the region, Lanao del Sur had the highest number of school leavers in
public elementary schools. During the school years 2014 to 2015 and 2016 to 2017, the province
accounted for 51.4 percent and 57.2 percent of the region’s total school leavers, respectively. [Refer to
Table 91]
Majority of the school leavers in public elementary schools were females: 15,784 (or 52.8 percent of
province’s total). [Refer to Table 92]

5.2.2.3. School Completion
Successful completion or graduation of elementary or secondary school level brings about additional
number of individuals with credentials and skills to the labor force pool and the human capital stock of
the province.
The school completion rates among students in public elementary and, to some extent, in public
secondary schools in Lanao del Sur were low compared to other school divisions in the region in the
previous years.

5.2.2.4. Cohort Survival
As one of the measures of internal efficiency of education, the group or cohort survival rate accounts for
“the percentage of enrollees at the beginning grade or year in a given school year who reached the final
grade or year of the elementary or secondary level,” according to the PSA. A high cohort survival rate
means that there is less wastage in education since the group of pupils is able to survive and complete
the final grade or year, each in his or her way. In part, the internal efficiency of education reflects the
quality of education.

Except for Marawi City, the two Lanao del Sur school divisions had the lowest cohort survival rates (less
than 50 percent) among students in public elementary school compared to other areas in the region in
the previous academic years. The Marawi City school division had shown a significant increase in survival
rate at 62.8 percent in SY 2016 to 2017 when it ranked among the lowest in the past. Even then, the 62.8
percent mark was lower than other school divisions in the region. [Refer to Figure 48]

5.3. Health
Improving human lives is at the core of development efforts in Lanao del Sur. The process by which
economic development proceeds is hinged on the relation between health and economic growth. Health
investments lead to longevity, which, in turn, increases labor force participation and long-term
productivity of the residents. At the same time, better health reduces social exclusion and encourages
community relations. In this sense, better health outcomes pave way for a improvements in human
development and community building.

To ensure wider access to health services, the Department of Health (DOH)/Ministry of Health (MOH)
demarcated Lanao del Sur into six health administrative areas (Balindong Health District, Unayan Health
District, Malabang Health District, Tamparan Health District, Wao Health District, and Malabayabao Health
District) and one Integrated Provincial Health Office (or, IPHO) based in Marawi City.
The municipalities of Tubaran and Lumbaca-Unayan, which are south of lake, are lodged under the
Malabayabao Health District, even if the former are physically adjacent to the three health districts of
Unayan, Tamparan, and Malabang. Prior to 2000, the two municipalities were included in the catchment
areas of the IPHO because the Unayan Health District could not deploy health personnel in LumbacaUnayan and Tubaran, because of limited resources. The IPHO made the generous move so just to continue
health care service delivery in underserved areas.
Beyond the concerns on the issue of access, and, most especially, amidst the pandemic, the local
government and the DOH/MOH have turned their attention to improving equities in health system. Equity
in health care service covers equity in health outcomes (except those related to genetic variations) and its
determinants such as education and wealth backgrounds, among others; equity in health service delivery
(which primarily drives access to health care); and equity in health financing. [Refer to Map 58]

5.3.1. Health Service Access
5.3.1.1. Health Facilities
Lanao del Sur currently has a total of 257 health facilities spread around the province, according to the
National Health Facility Registration of the DOH. These consist of five government district hospitals, one
medical center, 39 rural health units (RHUs), 165 barangay health centers (BHS), seven private infirmaries,
two private hospitals, and 38 birthing homes (34 of which are public birthing homes). [Refer to Map 59]
Balindong District Hospital, Unayan District Hospital, Wao District Hospital, Tamparan District Hospital,
and Dr. Serapio B. Montañer Memorial Hospital, which are all categorized by DOH as level 1 facilities, each
cater to the populace of the municipalities within their respective catchment. Currently, there is no
existing Provincial Hospital in Lanao del Sur nor a public hospital in the Malabayabao Health District.
All health facilities in Lanao del Sur are under the jurisdiction of the MOH of BARMM, except Amai Pakpak
Medical Center. The latter is a level-2 health facility in Marawi City, but it is administratively operated by
the DOH regional office in SOCCSKSARGEN (Region 12).

Public hospitals in the province cannot cope with the current demand given the existing supply capacity
of health services. The three district hospitals (Dr. Serapio B. Montaner, Wao, and Tamparan) have 25 bed
capacity each, while the remaining two have 10 beds each. Amaipakpak is currently the largest
government-owned hospital in Lanao del Sur, and it has a capacity of 200 beds. This brings the combined
total bed capacity of all public hospitals including Amai Pakpak Medical Center to 295. [Refer to Table 99]

As expected, the occupancy rates of the district hospitals all exceed 100 percent, with Dr. Serapio B.
Montaner Memorial Hospital the highest at 218 percent.
This means that Lanao del Sur had a bed-to-population ratio of 1: 3,976 based on the projected population
in 2020 derived from 2015 census of the PSA. Overcrowding of health facilities will be the future norm, as
has been, as the population of the province will continue to rise at geometric rate. At the existing level of
bed capacity, the bed-to-population ratio in the province will reach 1:6,363 in 2040. By then, the
municipalities within Balindong Health District will overshoot to 24,642 persons per bed. The catchment
areas of Malabayabao Health District continues to be unserved because it does not have a government
hospital. [Refer to Table 100]

Note: 1\ This refers to the bed capacity of Amai Pakpak which is not under the Lanao del Sur IPHO. The figure is included in this
table to get a sense of overall health service supply conditions in the province. 2\ “—“ means that the bed-to-population ratio is
undefined since there is no public hospital, hence hospital beds, in Malayabayabao Health District.
Sources: Lanao del Sur IPHO (bed capacity); PSA-CPH (2015 population levels and growth rates to calculate the projections)

The additional hospital beds needed by the province can be extrapolated from: the current bed capacity,
projected population, and the ideal hospital bed-to-population ratio of one bed per 1,000 persons which
was set by the DOH national office. In 2020 alone, the province would need additional 878 public hospital
beds. Given the existing capacity, the unmet need for public hospital beds of Lanao del Sur will soar to
1,582 by 2040. [Refer to Table 101]
Tamparan Health District consistently have the highest need for hospital beds, which will climb up to 447
units by 2040. Because Malabayabao Health District does not have any public hospital, constructing one
must accommodate at least 220 beds in 2020 or 351 beds by 2040 to meet the standard bed-to-population
ratio prescribed by the DOH.

The province’s two private hospitals are located in Marawi City and Tamparan. Six private infirmaries in
Marawi City and one in Malabang.
Aside from hospitals, Lanao del Sur has 39 RHUs. Each municipality has one RHU while Marawi City has
three. All RHUs, which are equipped with basic medical equipment, are designed to provide first response
treatments for patients with uncomplicated ailments.
About 29 RHUs in the municipalities have a standard RHU building. Other RHUs without the standard
facilities, have struggled within their means and resorted to other arrangements so just to prevent any
disruption in health care service provision. Eight municipalities utilize their respective BHS as their main
308

health units. Furthermore, because they have no standard health buildings, the municipalities of
Binidayan and Lumbayanague rely on temporary health facilities provided by their respective district
catchment and local government unit.
On average, the province served 29,324 persons per RHU in 2020. This will soar to 46,930 persons per
RHU by 2040. Marawi City and the two health districts of Malabang and Wao are the top three areas
where the ratio of RHU to population is highest for 2020 and 2040. Given the existing number of RHUs,
Marawi City alone will witness an overburdened capacity of approximately 98,124 persons per RHU by
2040. On average, each RHU in Wao and Malabang will serve 85,619 persons and 82,845 persons,
respectively, by 2040. These are way too high compared to the DOH prescribed RHU-to-population ratio
of 1:20,000. [Refer to Table 102]
This means that the province needed 19 more RHUs in 2020. If the needs in 2020 will continue to be
unmet, Lanao del Sur will require 54 more RHUs by 2040. [Refer to Table 103]

Each barangay is required to have one BHS. As part of the health care service delivery network in the
province, BHS provides for prenatal care, vaccination, and monitoring of morbidity. It also serves as a
referral system to better respond to health and medical needs.
Out of 1,159 barangays in Lanao del Sur, only 165 have BHS, according to the DOH National Health Facility
Registration in 2020 and verified by the IPHO. This figure already excludes the BHS destroyed in the urban
core of the capital during the 2017 siege. The BHS are mostly concentrated in Malabayabao Health District
(60) and the Wao Health District (30). Buadiposo-Buntong, which is under the Malabayabao Health
District, is the only municipality that has nearly met the one BHS-per barangay requirement of the DOH.
About 32 out of its total 33 barangays have BHS, as of 2020. In contrast, the Unayan Health District has
the least number of BHS—only seven of the combined total of 133 barangays under the administrative
jurisdiction of the health district have BHS. [Refer to Table 104]
Some municipalities have no BHS at all: Binidayan, Lumbatan, Lumbayanague, Pualas, and Sultan
Dumalondong.
The imperatives to install BHS across the communities are ever more present since 30 percent of
barangays in Lanao del Sur are classified as geographically isolated and disadvantaged areas.
If the deficits continue to unaddressed, each BHS in Lanao del Sur, on the average, will serve 11,377
persons by 2040 at the current supply capacity.

5.3.1.2. Health Human Resource
Human resource management is vital to the health care system in Lanao del Sur. Health personnel pertains
to staff involved in clinical or non-clinical interventions for public and individual health. The performance
and outcomes of health interventions are largely influenced by the availability of manpower, their skills
and knowledge, and responsive management to deliver health care services—apart from other health
inputs such as physical capital (health facilities and equipment) and consumables (medicines,
dispensations, disposable equipment, etc.).
Lanao del Sur currently has 31 physicians, 14 health nurses, seven dentists, 26 sanitary inspectors, five
medical technologists, and 87 midwives. [Refer to Table 105]
Unfortunately, their number fare below the rising demand for health and medical care services in the
province, despite the fact that many Mëranaws graduate in medical or public health courses yearly. Many
of them opt to migrate abroad or to other parts of the country given the high economic returns of their
professions compared to working in the far flung areas of the province, much more with the public sector.
The national standard for the number of persons to be served in the population is 20,000 individuals per
worker across most health care occupations. The human resource deficits in Lanao del Sur is acute. There
were 229,237 persons for every medical technologist in 2019. Similarly, there were 163,741 persons for
every dentists. If the 2019 capacity persists, then Lanao del Sur’s ability to cope with rising demand will
tremendously overstretch the human resources. This will breed high likelihood of poor quality care, which
takes toll on poor health outcome indicators.
If the province wants to have responsive health care, it will require the deployment of additional 1,072
midwives, 88 medical technologists, 86 dentists, 79 nurses, 67 sanitary inspectors, , and 67 physicians, by
2040. [Refer to Table 106]

None of the public hospitals have enough personnel based on the DOH-recommended number of health
workers. Similarly, some RHUs and BHS have shortage number of staff.
As a result, the DOH/MOH resorted to various temporary deployment programs of health personnel
across the country to augment the human resource shortage in the health care system in some areas.
Lanao del Sur benefited in such programs. In 2019, about seven doctors were assigned in the province
through the Doctors to the Barrios; 386 nurses under the Nurse Deployment Program; 155 midwives
under the Midwife for Every Community in BARMM/Rural Health Midwife Placement Program; 10 dentists
under the Dentist Deployment Program; four medical technologists under the Medical Technologist
Deployment Program; 98 personnel as Public Health Associates; and one of each of psychometrician,
nutritionist, and pharmacist.
Barangays considered as geographically isolated and disadvantaged by the LGU, are at a losing end in
terms of inequities in health outcomes and health service delivery system. If the province wants to
improve the local health system, it needs to actualize the decentralization of health services by
constructing more BHS, deploying more health workers, and assigning more resources including
equipment for the catchment barangays.

5.3.2. Health Outcomes
Improvements in health outcomes have been among of the main development objectives of Lanao del
Sur. This is borne out, in large part, by the existence of a positive association between health outcomes
and economic growth and development. On one hand, better indicators of population health status,
particularly maternal and child health outcomes, contribute both to the short-term and long-term
consequences of productivity which drives the economic dynamics of Lanao del Sur, like in many parts of
the world. On the other hand, high growth and, hence, high general level of incomes improve health
spending. There are, however, confounding variables that correspond to broader sets of policies
governing investment decisions, parental preferences, economic background, and parental health stock
that influence health outcomes.
5.3.2.1. Life Expectancy and Mortality Rates
Two decades ago, the average life expectancy in the province was 61.87 among males and 62.74 among
females. If one chose to live in Lanao del Sur, his or her life would be cut short by 4.24 years among males
and 8.9 years among females relative to the national average. Even compared to its immediate neighbor
(Lanao del Norte), residents of Lanao del Sur had lower number of expected years to live by 2.16 among
males and 5.96 among females. [Refer to Table 107]
The variation reflects the three aspects of inequities discussed earlier: inequity in health outcomes,
inequity in healthy service delivery systems, and inequity health financing. But, two decades have passed,
one can assume that this reality has changed due to improvements in access to health service and
incomes, ceteris paribus (i.e. holding all other factors like change in lifestyle or due to disasters constant).
The PSA has yet to issue any signs of improvements in the general life expectancy in Lanao del Sur once
the 2020 census is released.

Among the indicators being monitored in the health sector, maternal health along with newborn and child
health stand out. Both are reflected in the strategic goal of having better health outcomes as indicated in
the medium-term National Objectives for Health of the DHO.

316

Note that most of the data presented in the following tables on health outcomes were extracted from the
FHSIS annual reports of the DOH, except otherwise stated. All health facilities including the IPHO in Lanao
del Sur submit health statistics for the FHSIS on a regular basis. Recent data of the IPHO presented during
the PDPFP planning exercises, however, appear to diverge from the FHSIS data due to updating or for
other reasons. For the purpose of inter-provincial comparison of health statistics, the FHSIS data is a better
starting point. The trend and pattern of health outcomes of the recent health statistics of IPHO,
nevertheless, coincide with what the FHSIS data offers.
Among the success indicators in achieving better health outcomes is the decline in crude death rate, as
well as infant and maternal mortality rates. Relatively better access to health services prompted by the
installation of health facilities in some areas and rising incomes in the recent years contributed to the
improvements in health outcomes. The province is on its track in meeting its medium term targets.
The reduction in maternal and infant mortality rates is closely associated with improvements in facilitybased deliveries, complete antenatal care attended by health service providers, and full immunization of
children. Maternal and infant mortalities are highly preventable provided the population have access to
proper and timely dispensation of health care services throughout the entire period of pregnancy and
delivery.
The success of Lanao del Sur in health outcomes over the recent years extend across space. Compared to
its neighbors such as Bukidnon and Misamis Oriental, and to the Philippine average, Lanao del Sur and
Marawi City have lower mortality rates (crude death rate, maternal and infant mortality rates). Except for
crude death rates, Lanao del Sur fares well over Maguindanao in terms of the two mortality rates. The
same pattern holds true relative to the autonomous region’s average. [Refer to Table 108, Table 109, and
Table 110]
Interpreting the low mortality rates in Marawi City relative to its neighboring major cities like Cagayan de
Oro, Iligan, and Cotabato, while commendable, should be taken in context. It can be because of vigorous
efforts of the local government to improve health outcomes, or because improvements in general income
has increased access of households to expensive health care found in other major cities. The reason why
mortality rates in the three major cities are high is that many patients, especially those with means, from
different provinces often opt for the big and well equipped hospitals (at least level 2) in Cagayan de Oro,
Iligan, or Cotabato for treatment including involving emergency cases. These hospitals offer services
beyond primary care (e.g. custodial, clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic care). Patients who expired in the
host city, albeit they had come from other provinces including Lanao del Sur or from Marawi City, were
recorded where they were pronounced dead.

5.3.2.2. Maternal Health
Investing in women’s health has tremendous benefits because it has significant consequences on the
quality of life of a child. The intergenerational health spillovers of improved women’s health include high
birth weight, better chances of neonatal survival, full cognitive development, better school performance,
and high long-term labor productivity. Child undernutrition is linked to fetal undernutrition which can be
prevented if pregnant women have access to proper health care.48
The share of pregnant women in Lanao del Sur who have access to at least four antenatal care visits
remained highest compared to its neighboring provinces in the past few years. In fact it has been
consistently higher than the national and ARMM’s average since 2014. Marawi City’s access, however
oscillated starting 2017 as result of the massive displacement of families due to the siege but picked up
the following year. [Refer to Table 111]
The share of deliveries (both normal or other procedures) done at health facilities significantly improved
reaching 82.1 percent in Lanao del Sur and 83.6 percent in Marawi City in 2018 from a mere 8.9 percent
and 13.5 percent, respectively, in 2005. [Refer to Table 112] The same pattern holds true for deliveries
attended by health workers where Lanao del Sur’s performance surpassed some of the adjacent provinces
and the ARMM, and inched its way closer to the national average starting 2017. [Refer to Table 113]
The percent of postpartum women who visited at least two post pregnancy care was high in Lanao del
Sur. The figures for Marawi City, however, were consistently low relative to the region’s average from
2014 to 2018. The reasons why this might be the case are: (i) there are quite a still substantial number of
barangays without BHS where primary health care are given, and (ii) those with means prefer visiting
health care providers in Iligan City or Cagayan del Oro City. [Refer to Table 114]

5.3.2.3. Family Planning and Potential for Demographic Dividends
While Lanao del Sur has witnessed low rates of mortality, it is yet to achieve a balanced rate of fertility so
that it can reap the benefits of “demographic dividends”. The latter occurs once the population transitions
to a low mortality and fertility rate regime so that the a bulge in the population age structure will result
in high number of working-age population and reduction in dependency ratios. The benefits of the
demographic dividends can happen only when economic and labor policies accompany the demographic
shift to produce a high level of labor productivity and the desired levels of economic and social
development.
To reduce fertility rates, Lanao del Sur has embarked on responsible parenthood and family planning
programs including the clinical methods in reducing the unrestrained number of pregnancy. The
contraceptive prevalence rate provides a measure of population (both men and women) coverage of
contraceptive use, taking into account all sources of supply and all contraceptive methods. It is the most
widely reported measure of outcome for family planning programs at the population level.
The indicator is often associated with better health, women’s empowerment, population management.
Parents who availed of responsible health programs are expected to have more time for themselves which
they can devote to other productive use. Global studies even suggest that better access to contraceptive
use is likely to increase higher educational attainment of women and job seeking behavior towards
professional careers. It also serves as a proxy measure of access to reproductive health services that are
essential for meeting many Millennium Development Goals, especially the child mortality, maternal
health and gender related goals.
A decade ago, only 10 percent of the eligible population in Lanao del Sur received contraceptives. The
contraceptive prevalence rate jumped to 33.3 percent in 2014. It plateaued since then, until it slightly
picked up in 2018. There are a substantial number of new acceptors but some opted to stop contraceptive
use in the thick of it, for various reasons. In comparison, other provinces such as Lanao del Norte and
Misamis Oriental, and cities like Cagayan de Oro and Cotabato consistently experienced a steep increase
in contraceptives use, end of period. [Refer to Table 115]
The uptick in contraceptive use in Lanao del Sur is attributed to the active campaign of the health workers
in convincing the populace in availing and enrolling in the program. Likewise, the cooperation of the
Islamic Councils in creating fatwas or Islamic rulings on the use of contraceptives has greatly aided in the
increase as well. To be more widely accessible, family planning and contraceptive use must be tied to
activities related to behavioral change since many still do not fully understand the value and methods
applied in the birth control program.

5.3.2.4. Child Health
Investing in the health of children in Lanao del Sur has huge potential, not only because it is a basic human
right, but also because it generates substantial private and social returns. The debilitating effect of poor
health is it lowers both short- and long-term labor productivity and it breeds poverty. It also works the
other way around: poverty results in reduced amount of household investments in health and nutrition
of children, making the latter prone to contracting diseases. The sliver of hope is that many of the illnesses
are preventable starting at the early stage of life cycle.
Lanao del Sur has the highest percent of children below two years old who are fully immunized compared
to other provinces. In fact, the full immunization rate is higher than ARMM’s and national average. The
full immunization rate for Marawi City picked up in 2016, although still lower than in 2005, but it plunged
after the 2017 siege. [Refer to Table 116]
The displacement of residents significantly reduced access to primary health care in the city, but it also
but it also encouraged influx of new target population through forced migration in other areas of the
province as well. Apart from displacement, the Dengvaxia controversy in 2017 prompted parents to refuse
their children receive vaccination due to fear of the probable lethal side effects, even many of these side
effects were unfounded.
The rate for the prevalence of underweight among children has been steadily decreasing for the past 5
years which signifies a better state of nutrition among the children. [Refer to Figure 50]

While the underweight prevalence rate among children declined, the status of acute malnutrition in the
province has not been resolved completely, albeit it is improving. [Refer to Table 117] Cases of both severe
and moderate standing has still been reported over the past two years with almost a hundred thousand
children, who were under five years old, screened. Compared to 2017 however, the number of children
cured from malnutrition has improved in 2018 with a cured rate of 60 percent (or 159 cases) from the
previous year’s 45 percent (or 31 cases).

In 2019, poliomyelitis, a highly contagious disease that affects children and can cause paralysis, reemerged in Lanao del Sur. The province has long been declared polio-free for 17 years until a three-year
old girl was found to be positive of the disease. Additional patients also emerged from other provinces
thereafter. The DOH, in response, launched a campaign called Sabayang Patak Kontra Polio nationwide.
Given the urgency to suppress the spread of the disease, the first round of the campaign was initiated in
Lanao del Sur. The Synchronized Polio Vaccination campaign is a three-part activity which aims to boost
immunization coverage against polio by giving three doses of oral polio vaccine to all children five years
old and below, regardless of their immunization status. The first two rounds of the activity that was
conducted during October and November 2019 boosted successful results.
About 89.07 percent of target eligible population were covered during the first round and 101 percent in
the second round. [Refer to Table 118]

5.3.2.5. Leading Causes of Morbidity and Mortality
Among the leading causes of morbidity in the province in 2018 were diabetes, essential hypertension,
pneumonia and diarrheal diseases. [Refer to Table 119] These diseases were also among, if not direct
causes of, the leading mortality cases. Cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases are more often than
not triggered by lifestyle diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. [Refer to Table 120]. Such diseases
are not curable, but they are preventable and can be managed given the proper rendering of health care
services.

5.4. Social Welfare
Removing barriers to social inclusion is one of the development priorities of Lanao del Sur. It is more than
just reducing poverty as a form of deprivation. Social inclusion encompasses providing means and venues,
and creating an enabling environment for individuals and certain groups to advance their quality of life
through greater participation in wider spheres of development processes including economic, social,
environmental, political, and cultural. These groups include differently abled persons, senior citizens,
children, persons deprived of liberty, victims of abuse, internally displaced persons, below minimum wage
earners. Providing voices and enforcing the rights to improve the welfare of non-persons such as animals
are also covered for reasons of Islamic morals, basic decency, and humanity, apart from prevailing legal
mandates.
The province considers the evolving consideration on the spatial dimension of social exclusion. The
geographic concentration of socially excluded groups has given rise to the concept of various forms of
deprivation traps, e.g. poverty traps, in some neighborhoods.
Lanao del Sur has yet to strengthen its programs and social policies on social inclusion. Delivery of basic
services to the marginalized is inadequate. Beyond health, education, water, sanitation, and electricity
access, these services must also include social protection. The presence of social welfare facilities is a first
step of increasing their access to interventions and their voices be heard.

5.4.1. Residential Care Facility
Custodial or residential care refers to a service delivery that operates round the clock and that provides
alternative family care arrangements to the poorest, the vulnerable, and the disadvantaged individuals in
crisis whose needs cannot be adequately met by their families and relatives or by any other form of
alternative family care arrangements.
Currently, there is no functional residential care facility in the province to adequately address the needs
of children in conflict with the law (juvenile delinquents) and women and children in difficult
circumstances (VAWC victims).
Lanao del Sur has few cases of reported incidents involving VAWC and children in conflict with the law.
[Refer to Table 121 and Table 122]
The informal institution of maratabat among families and clans, however, restrains help-seeking behavior
to local authorities. This may explain fewer number of cases being reported to law enforcers and the social
welfare desk. At the same time, maratabat acts as a deterrence on inflicting violence against women (even
among married couples), much more sexual abuse, because of foreboding spiral to rido. Local traditions
have high regard or special space for women in the Mëranaw society so that any infractions, even by mere
suspicion, results in strong censure, or it often gravitates towards rido.

5.4.2. Day Care Centers
It is said that three million Filipino children across the country are found to be suffering from malnutrition
and lack of opportunities. Pre-school children who are under five years old are the most vulnerable to
the ill-effects of malnutrition and lack of social and mental stimulation, with devastating effects on longterm human development. Lanao del Sur is no exception, where some children live in impoverished areas.
The estimated number of children below five years old in Lanao del Sur in 2020 reached 173,030. It is
projected to soar to 277,360 by 2040. As expected, Marawi City had the most number of children under
five: 29,968 persons in 2020. Next to Marawi are Lumba Bayabao, Wao, Malabang, and Tamparan.
Together including Marawi City, they comprise almost a third (30.2 percent) of the total number of
children under five years old in the province. [Refer to Table 123]

The LGU, together with ARMM-Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), now BARMMMinistry of Social Services and Development (MSSD), has exerted relentless effort to combat malnutrition
through supplemental feeding to support the nationwide program on nutrition. This is twinned with
learning activities for preschoolers in daytime care centers (also called daycare centers or child
development centers) to stimulate cognitive, psychological, and physical development of children.
However, not all barangays in Lanao del Sur have daytime care centers. [Refer to Map 60] About 73.8
percent of total number barangays in the province have daytime care centers, despite the legal mandate
to have one per barangay.49 Municipal variations exists. Some municipalities have more daytime care
centers than the total number of barangays under their respective jurisdictions: Lumbaca-Unayan, Wao,
Sultan Dumalondong, Kapatagan, Butig, Calanogas, Poona Bayabao (Gata), Bacolod-Kalawi (Bacolod
Grande), Picong (Sultan Gumander), and Tubaran. Others have daytime care centers less than half the
total number of their respective barangays: Taraka, Bayang, Marantao, and Maguing. [Refer to Table 124].

49

An Act Establishing a Day Care Center in Every Barangay, Instituting Therein a Total Development and Protection
of Children Program, Appropriating Funds Therefore, and for Other Purposes (RA No. 6972) enacted in November
23, 1990.

328

Expressed in terms of facility ratio to population of children under five in 2020, assuming that the 2018
supply capacity of daytime care centers holds, Marawi City, as expected, stood out at 491.3 children per
facility. The following municipalities have facility-to-population ratio above the province’s average of
202.4 children per facility: Marawi, Marantao, Maguing, Lumba Bayabao (Maguing), Taraka, Masiu, Kapai,
Tugaya, Piagapo, Butig, Bayang, Tamparan, Sultan Dumalondong, Binidayan, Malabang, Mulondo,
Saguiaran, and Ditsaan-Ramain.
Given the legal requirements, Lanao del Sur will need 324 additional daytime care centers by 2040 in order
to reach the more needy children, protect their interests, and prevent the loss of human potentials. [Refer
to Table 125]. The expansion of number of facilities can be achieved with the collective efforts of the
public and private sector through the active involvement of non-governmental organizations. Also,
support to the provision of adequate day-care operation and facilities is also significant.

The LGU offers various welfare programs for the senior citizens including social pensions for indigent
senior citizens, monthly medical allowance, medical missions, feeding program, gifts, celebration of the
Elderly Filipino Week, and Islamic seminars. In addition, the BARMM-MSSD offers senior citizens social
and self enhancement programs, livelihood assistance, cash grants, referral system, as well as IDs.

5.4.4. Differently Abled Persons
An estimated total of 2,447 (or 0.2 percent of total population) in Lanao del Sur were differently abled
persons (or persons with disabilities or PWDs) in 2019, according to the PSA data. This represents a
significant decline from 2010 at 12,400 (or 1.3 percent of total population). In 2000, there were 3,500
persons with different abilities (or 0.4 percent of total population). [Refer to Table 127].
However, the 2019 figure diverge from the records of BARMM-MSSD placing such group of individuals at
2,228. Further, most them were concentrated in Marawi City (304), Lumba Bayabao (260), Saguiaran
(158), Balindong or Watu (114), and Wao (113). Their combined total represents 42.6 percent of total
number of differently abled persons in the province.

Several programs of the regional government cater to individuals with different abilities. These include
disability prevention, assistance to physical restoration, job placement, social and self enhancement
programs, and livelihood assistance. The province LGU too has programs on special social service for
elderly with disability, monthly medical allowance, information dissemination on disability prevention,
and referral system.

336

The Lanao del Sur LGU apportions one percent of its local revenues to programs for the senior citizens
and persons with disability. The funds are budgeted for: 1). Office of the Senior Citizens Affairs and 2).
the Persons with Disability Office.
Improving the welfare of differently abled individuals require a system-wide intervention. More efforts
have to be done to require all public and private facilities including buildings and transportation system,
as well as public spaces including parks to be friendly to people with special needs to increase their
participation in the society.

Chapter 6: Strategic Infrastructures: Transportation, Communication,
Energy, and Water System

I

nvestments in quality infrastructures such as transportation, communication, energy, water system,
and public schools or hospitals (extensively discussed in the previous chapter) underpin economic
activities. It also facilitates the advancement of human development, and it increases community
interactions with right mix of economic, social, and urban management policies.

6.1. Transportation
Transportation is the backbone of the local economy of Lanao del Sur. It moves people closer to
opportunities and public services. At the firm level, improvements in transportation infrastructure enables
seamless flow of factors of production including raw materials in the agrarian economy to production sites
in primary and secondary growth areas. Adequate transportation system also aids movement of goods to
markets.
At the municipality/city or provincial level, better infrastructures and management reduce transportation
costs which merits the sector to play a central role in paving way for localization of industries and
agglomeration of economies. At the neighborhood level, the complex interaction of transportation with
the local economy, culture, environment, geography, security, and governance can influence the pace of
social inclusion and sustainable urbanization in the province.
Lanao del Sur’s transport network consists of roads, small- size ports, and community airports. All towns
in Lanao del Sur, including Marawi City, are accessible by various modes of land transportation: private
cars, jeepneys, tricycles, and single motor cycles. Prior to the siege in 2017, there were two major land
transportation public terminals in Marawi City, the GMA Terminal and the ICOM Terminal.

6.1.1. Land Transportation
6.1.1.1. Land Transportation Infrastructure
Lanao del Sur’s road network consists of national roads, provincial roads, municipal roads, and barangay
roads which include farm-to-market roads. [Refer to Map 61] National roads have a total length of 251.83
km., while provincial roads reached 364.33 km, based on the field survey done by the Department of
Interior and Local Government in 2017. [Refer to Table 128]
The Provincial Engineer’s Office compiled a list of provincial roads including those surveyed by the DILG.
As of 2018, Lanao del Sur has a total of 498.79 km. of provincial roads. [Refer to Table 129]

Given the indicated total land area and the projected total population count of the province in 2020 and
the DILG road data, Lanao del Sur has a road density (combining national and provincial roads) of 0.045.50
The BARMM region has a road density of 0.09, Mindanao has 0.16, and Philippines has 0.19, according to
a 2018 Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA) report.51
This means that the province will need an additional 26.50-km. of roads (provincial or national) so that
Lanao del Sur will be at par with the Mindanao road density, or an additional 147.00-km. roads to meet
the Philippine average road density.
Various sections of the existing provincial roads and the Lanao circumferential road serve as the main
routes for internal circulation within the province. The circumferential road, which has a total length of
113.817 km., is an all-weather national secondary road made of concrete. It has three component roads:
Masiu–Ganassi Road, Marawi–Pugaan Road, and Marawi–Masiu Road. The circumferential road is
maintained by the Department of Public Works and Highways.
These routes allows ease of conveyance and connects towns and the capital more closely to production
and distribution activities within the province. Further, this road network connects remote communities
with Marawi City, where employment options are more concentrated and services and facilities more
readily available.
While Lanao del Sur strives to achieve internal physical integration, the province has fair amount and level
of road infrastructures for external physical integration. There are four major entry points in the province
connecting it to its neighbors like Lanao del Norte, Maguindanao, Bukidnon, and Misamis Oriental and
major port cities like Iligan City and Cagayan de Oro City. These roads serve to link the province to the
primary and secondary growth poles across Mindanao bringing producers closer to markets, workers to
jobs, students to school, and the ill to tertiary hospitals.
To the north, the Iligan-Marawi Road joins Lanao del Sur via Saguiaran and Lanao Norte. The road is part
of the pan-Philippine highway leading up to Iligan City and Cagayan de Oro City. To the northeast, the
Wao-Kalilangan Road connects Lanao del Sur through Wao and Bumbaran (Amai Manabilang), and
Kalilangan in Bukidnon. To the south, the Cotabato-Lanao Road links Lanao del Sur through Kapatagan to
Maguindanao via Matanog. And, to the southwest, the Malabang-Tukuran Road allows Lanao del Sur by
way of Picong to flow to Sultan Naga Dimaporo in Lanao del Norte.
To date, the construction of the 40-kilometer concrete “dream road” that connects Kapai to the
municipality of Talakag in Bukidnon is near completion. Further, due to the poor road surface condition
of the provincial road linking Balindong (Watu) and Piagapo to the municipality of Pantao Ragat in Lanao

del Norte, a house bill was passed to convert the said provincial road section into a national road. The bill
will facilitate fast tracking any proposed measures for the rehabilitation of the road.
There are proposed major infrastructure projects for Lanao del Sur that are included in the National
Expenditure Program (NEP) of the DPWH and the Bangsamoro Expenditure Program (BEP) for 2020 and
2021 of BARMM.
Included in the pipeline of the NEP are the rehabilitation along Cotabato-Malabang-Lanao del Norte Road,
Masiu-Ganassi Road and Marawi-Malabang Road. The department also on-going construction of road
projects funded by Japan International Cooperation Agency: the construction of 18.97- kilometer Marawi
Tran-central Road Phase 1 and 2 , 23-kilometer Marawi Trans-central Road Phase 3 and 19.8- kilometer
Marawi City Ring Road. The Asian Development Bank committed to finance the 21.87- kilometer Transcentral Road Phase 4.
The Bangsamoro Government identified the following road projects in Lanao del Sur under its 2021
expenditure program. [Refer to Table 130]

6.1.1.2. Quality of Land Transportation Infrastructure
Based on the DILG’s record on Roads and Bridges Information System (RBIS), the provincial roads in Lanao
del Sur is composed of 310.85 kms concrete, 9.8 kms gravel, and 40.45 kms earth, as of 2019. A length of
3.23 kms is in mixed form. The provincial road network has a total of 69 road sections that cut through
the province’s 38 municipalities and the capital. This is on top of the 134.46-km total length of un-surveyed
and newly opened provincial roads. [Refer to Figure 51]

However, the JICA published a report in 2018 indicating that the total length of paved national roads in
Lanao del Sur was 281.85 km and the paved provincial roads, 150.90 km.
The report conducted a field survey that assessed the conditions of the road surface based on an indicator
called International Roughness Index (IRI). The field survey utilized an equipment, Dynamic Response
Intelligent Monitoring System, developed by the University of Tokyo.
About 11.5 percent (32.5 km.) of paved national roads and 79.7 percent (120.2 km.) of paved provincial
roads are in bad condition, i.e. an IRI of at least 7, which means that they require immediate intervention.
In addition, about 27.3 percent (76.85 km.) of paved national roads and 16.1 percent (24.30 km) of paved
provincial roads considered of poor state, i.e. having an IRI between five and seven. [Refer to Figure 52,

6.3. Energy
Energy is a catalyst to economic growth since production and consumption activities involve energy as an
input. Modernizing the economy requires adequate and stable supply of energy to allow higher level
production of goods and services. Public services such as education, health, and disaster management
become more effective and accessible to the constituents when public infrastructures and communities
are energized. Even in violence prevention, well-lighted areas is associated with lesser incidence of crimes.
Amongst households, access to energy sources for lighting and for cooking frees up precious household
time. More time becomes available for child rearing, aiding children do their homework, or having simple
quality and leisurely time among family members. A sustainable source of energy means Lanao del Sur
will be in an enviable position in achieving lasting improvements in the standard of living.
The natural endowment of Lanao del Sur allowed the province to host the energy supply generation for
the rest of Mindanao, yet the capacity to distribute energy to the constituents in Lanao del Sur has barely
met the local demand for decades.

6.3.1. Power Generation
The Lake Lanao, which drains through the 26-km. Agus River, serves as the major source of power supply
of the mainland Mindanao. Two of the seven power generating plants of the National Power Corporation
(NPC) are located in the province. The rest are in Lanao del Norte. Completed in 1992 and 1994, the Agus
I hydroelectric power plant is located right at the center of Marawi City and has two unit run-of-river type
plants. Agus I was constructed starting 1979. Agus II hydroelectric power plant, on the other hand, in
Saguiaran was built in 1975 but started its commercial operation in 1979.
The combined capacity generated by the NPC is 1,000 megawatts (MW). Agus I and Agus II have a rated
capacity of 80 MW and 120 MW, respectively. [Refer to Table 134]
Aside from these, the Matling Industrial Corporation also operates a mini-hydroelectric plant, with a rated
capacity of 5 MW.

The obsolescence of the Agus I and Agus II hydroelectric power plants is building up. No major
rehabilitation has been done for the past few decades.
Climate change has seen drying up in some portions of the lake in recent years, which threatens the ability
of the Agus I and Agus II to generate enough electricity in the next decades to come.
Other sources of renewable energy has not been fully explored in the province, aside from solar energy
individually installed at the household level or at community facility-level (e.g. street lights). It has not yet
arrived at the point of exploring the potential of solar panel farms or wind energy farms and allow
economies of scale to kick in.

6.3.2. Electricity Transmission
The NPC has also two power substations in the province: one in Barangay Saduc in Marawi City and
another in the Municipality of Bubong. The Saduc substation ceased to operate a decade ago.
The Lanao del Sur Electric Cooperative, Inc. (LASURECO), the electricity distributor in the province except
in Wao and Bumbaran (Amai Manabilang), has substations in Marawi City, Ganassi, Malabang, and
Tugaya. The distribution substations accommodate neighborhood transformers which step down the
voltage and carry electricity through distribution lines to residential communities and commercial
districts.
The increase in demand for electricity had LASURECO propose to the Task Force Bangon Marawi the
establishment of a 20 MVA distribution substation in Gadongan in Marawi City in 2020. [Refer to Table
135]

In the past, all municipalities in the province, except those in the south (Coastal Cluster), tapped electricity
distributed by the substation in Marawi City. With limited capacity, this led to unstable supply of electricity
in many parts of the province. In addition, Illegal tapping and mismanagement bled the finances of
LASURECO, resulting in frequent power interruptions and underinvestment in electricity distributionVision 2040

related physical capital. System losses reached 38.21 percent (or 44.561 MW) in 2015. But, this all changed
after the 2017 siege where improving electricity transmission and distribution has gained particular
attention from the local and national government.
LASURECO has vowed to improve the energization level of the province. It received significant support
from other service providers including Meralco and the national government such as the National
Electrification Administration (NEA) to upgrade the substation in Ganassi and replace electric posts and
lines. The National Scheduled and unscheduled power interruptions were minimized and prior notice of
power service interruption is now being implemented. An enhanced Distribution Development Plan (DDP)
is now being implemented which includes daily monitoring of power situation as well as performance
assessment and benchmarking.

6.3.3. Electricity Distribution
LASURECO supplies the household power requirements of the constituents of the province. It divides its
market (or franchise area) in Lanao del Sur into three districts, and each district consists of two clusters:
District I (Basak Cluster and Unayan Cluster), District II (Guilopa Cluster and Coastal Cluster), and District
III (Marawi Cluster and Balo-i Cluster). Aside from Lanao del Sur, LASURECO serves four municipalities in
Lanao del Norte: Balo-i, Pantar, Pantao Ragat, and Tagoloan. These four municipalities comprise the Baloi Cluster which is part of District III. The three municipalities of Saguiaran, Piagapo, and Kapai in Lanao del
Sur are under the Balo-i Cluster. [Refer to Map 65]
Wao and Bumbaran (Amai Manabilang) are served by the First Bukidnon Electric Cooperative, Inc.
(FIBECO) which is based in the neighboring province.

excluding Wao and Bumbaran or Amai Manabilang, have access to electricity. [Refer to Table 136]
Barangays outside the catchment area of LASURECO tap electricity through the Alliance for Mindanao
Off-Grid Renewable Energy (AMORE). A project of the United States Agency for International
Development in partnership with the Department of Energy, the former ARMM, Mirant Philippines, Inc.,
and Winrock International, Inc. between 2002 and 2004, AMORE used renewable energy technology
(hydro and solar) that proves to be the most economically-viable option for those un-energized
communities across the ARMM. Economies of scale dictate that the cost of extension of transmission grids
in these barangays is prohibitive so that solar and hydropower are viable options.

In 2015, about 94.6 percent of captive customer connections of LASURECO were from residential areas,
four percent commercial, and 0.04 percent industrial.
According a JICA report,53 Lanao del Sur has barangay electrification rate of 67 percent compared to
ARMM’s 63 percent as of December 2003. However, only 26 percent of households in the province were
connected to LASURECO, according to the JICA

6.3.4. Household Access to Energy Source
According to the 2015 census, majority (68.8 percent) of the household in Lanao del Sur have access to
electricity, their primary source of fuel for lighting. About 14.3 percent and 12.6 percent of total
households use solar panel and solar lamps for lighting. Others rely on kerosene (3.5 percent), liquefied
petroleum gas or LPG (0.4), and vegetable oil (0.1 percent). [Refer to Figure 56]

6.4. Water and Sanitation
Investing in water and sanitation has shown globally that it improves economic growth and poverty
reduction.
In Lanao del Sur, the irony is at the fore of development issues where the abundance of fresh water from
its lakes, river systems, springs, and groundwater has not translated to better access to drinking water
and sanitation among its residents. They are called “people of the lake” for no other reasons, and drinking
and cooking with water from whichever source they can get have become a daily gamble on health.
Diarrhea which is caused by poor hygiene and lack of access to safe drinking water is the top four leading
cause of morbidity and top ten cause of mortality in Lanao del Sur in 2018. The dreadful resurgence of
cholera in 2018 especially among displaced persons living in less than desirable temporary shelters is
blamed on poor sanitation. The economic and health burden of diarrhea, which is a preventable disease,
is associated with stunting affecting child development. Its long-term consequences on productivity is
enormous.

364

The stark mismatch of the abundance of water and of the capacity to supply safe and potable water and
clean toilets to the household population suggests a missing middle—the need for an effective and
efficient governance on water and sanitation management in Lanao del Sur.

6.4.1. Access to Safe Water for Drinking
The 2015 census indicates that one-fifth (or 20.9 percent) of total number of households in the province
relied on lakes, rivers, and rain as their main source of drinking water. Some used protected spring (11.4
percent), unprotected spring (7.5 percent), dug well (6.5 percent), tubed or piped shallow well (3.5
percent). About 47.1 percent of households were more fortunate to have access to relatively safe drinking
water, and they are classified as follows: shared faucet community water system (15.1 percent), own-use
faucet community water (14.6 percent), shared tubed or piped deep well (11.5 percent), and own-use
tubed or piped deep well (5.9 percent). [Refer to Figure 57]

The findings of the 2015 census do not diverge much from the DOH-FHSIS data in 2019. According to the
latter, only 46.8 percent of total households in the province had access to basic safe water supply,
primarily Level 2. On the other hand, half (50.7 percent) of the total households in Marawi City had access
to basic safe water—also mainly level 2. The remaining 53.2 percent for Lanao del Sur and 49.3 percent
for Marawi City depended on unsafe source of water supply for drinking. [Refer to Table 137]
Compared to its neighbors, Lanao del Sur and Marawi City had the lowest proportion of households with
access to basic safe water supply.

Among public schools, access to safe water for drinking is also a struggle. In SY 2015 to 2016, about 16.4
percent of public elementary schools in the province had no water available water supply while about
47.3 percent relied on rainwater. Among public secondary schools for the same year, about 32.4 percent
had no available water supply and 30.8 percent depended on rainwater.
According to the NEDA Resolution No. 5, series 199854, a level 2 water supply system refers to communal
faucets system or standposts. Each faucet serves about four to six households, and is suitable in rural
areas and urban fringe for clustered houses. A point source, also called level 1 water supply facility, refers
to protected well or developed spring with an outlet but without a distribution system because houses
are sparsely distributed. A level 1 water facility normally serves an average of 15 households. Lastly, a
level 3 water system has a source, reservoir, piped distribution network with adequate treatment facility,
and household taps. Both level 2 and level 3 must meet the requirements of the Philippines National
Standards for Drinking Water defined the Code of Sanitation (PD No. 856) and DENR Administrative Order
No. 26-A, series of 1994.
Households that depend on tubed or piped deep wells or shallow well within their own property have
installed electric-powered motorized pumps to draw out water into the faucets. This means that
electricity and water supply are complement goods for this segment of household population.
However, the LDS LGU uses a different definition of the classifications of water supply facilities, outlined
below. [Refer to Table 138]

6.4.2.1. Marawi City Water District
The Marawi City Water District traces its origin during the American period. It was then call Marantao
Artesian Well which was constructed by the United States Army in 1906. The National Waterworks
Sewerage Administration (NAWASA) once managed the Marantao Artesian Well and it initiated some
improvements in the water system.
The Marawi City Water District (MCWD) was created in September 25, 1973 as a government-owned and
controlled corporation. The water district was the third among the ten pilot initiative established by Local
Water Utilities Administration (LWUA).
Right before the Marawi siege in 2017, the water district had 15.350 km pipelines, and 3,648 active and
400 inactive concessionaires. [Refer to Table 140].
Its five pump stations (MCWD Pump Station 1, MCWD Pump Station 2, City Jail Pump Station, NPC Agus 1
Pump Station, and Bangon Pump Station) had a combined 364 cluster boxes. The first two are collectively
called by the locals as Pumping which is where the MCWD office is also located. The water district had
two ground reservoir—one is located in Campo Ranao with a capacity of 1,000 cubic meters and the other
reservoir had a capacity of 280 cubic meters in Barangay Mocado Cadingilan. The Marawi City Water
District served 41 barangays of the total 96 in the city. [Refer to Table 141]

The siege decimated the urban core of Marawi. Public utility facilities including water distribution facilities
were not spared leaving only 19 remaining barangays with 156 cluster boxes. Only 1,606 remained of its
concessionaires. The pumping stations (Pumping, Bangon, and NPC Agus 1) and the Campo Ranao
reservoir are still working. [Refer to Table 142]

The destruction of facilities paved groundwork for partnerships and aid from various private and
international NGOs including multilateral and bilateral organizations to rehabilitate water infrastructures
and improve the water distribution system in the city. The MCWD inked a partnership agreement with
Maynilad Water Services Inc., a contractor of the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage, to draft the
Water Supply System Master Plan of the city. The Asian Development Bank funded the rehabilitation of
existing pipelines of the 19 barangays outside ground zero.

The master plan for the city identified five phases of rehabilitation efforts which includes repair or
replacement of pipes, water meters, and cluster boxes. [Refer to Table 143] Two pumping stations will be

The DILG national funded a permanent water pump station in Barangay Mipaga to serve the displaced
families in temporary shelters in Barangay Sagonsongan. The management of the Mipaga water pump is
lodged at the Marawi City LGU and not the MCWD. The Lanao del Sur LGU also constructed a water pump
station to serve its employees and their families residing in a housing complex. The province LGU, not the
MCWD, manages the water pump station. Such management setups put the issue of economies of scale
needed to successfully run public utilities (including water distribution) which are inherently replete with
market failures. Like any businesses characterized as natural monopolist, their only way to financially
survive in the long-term is if they adopt the calculus of volumes, hence economies of scale, to recoup the
huge amount of fixed investments as initial capital.
6.4.2.2. Wao Water District
The Wao Water District was created by its LGU in 1991 to address the looming problems on its existing
water system. The water district serves four clusters of barangay, and about 1,253 clients (mostly
households) are connected to the water system. [Refer to Table 144]

6.4.2.3. Other Foreign-Assisted Water Systems
The Mindanao Development Authority in partnership with the Development Bank of the Philippines and
the DILG introduced the solar-powered water works project in Lanao del Sur. Taraka was one of the first
recipients of the project. The municipality, which has 43 barangays and a population of 23,644 in 2015,
has been relying on water supply from the three main river tributaries of Lake Lanao. The rising trends of
population growth and densification of certain area polluted their water source including the rivers. It is
a common sight for many households to boil water they fetch from the rivers before they could even drink
it. Few affluent families dug deep wells powered by diesel engines.

374

6.4.2. Basic Sanitation
A study by a group of scientists and researchers at the Mindanao State University-Iligan Institute of
Technology published an assessment report56 on the water quality of Lake Lanao in 2020. They found that
the lake has high contamination of heterotrophic bacteria and fecal coliform, suggesting that the water
from the lake is unfit for consumption due to the health risks it may pose.
This comes as no surprise because only 34.2 percent of total households in the province except Marawi
City in 2019 had access to basic sanitation including clean toilets. The remaining majority (65.8 percent)
had no access at all relying on open or closed pit or lakes or rivers when they want to relieve themselves.
In Marawi City, 62.4 percent had access to sanitary toilets. This figures pales in comparison with its
neighboring provinces and cities. [Refer to Table 145]
While there is no available data, some residents use public sanitation infrastructures shared toilets in
“bathing” areas in masajid (mosques).

Problems in water distribution contribute to poor sanitation infrastructures and poor maintenance. Many
still rely on dugout latrine (de buhos) instead of water-sealed toilets.

Many LGUs do not strictly enforce the sanitation code (PD No. 856) which resulted in the proliferation of
poorly constructed plumbing system including septic tanks. In addition, most homeowners had not had
their tanks serviced on regular basis because there is no known septic tank siphoning services in Lanao
del Sur including Marawi City. Poor construction and poor maintenance of septic tanks allowed human
wastes and contaminated water to directly penetrate the ground water and Lake Lanao. In the same way,
the raw sewage in pit facilities were directly discharged into the lake and rivers.
There is stigma (coming from maratabat) associated with cleaning septic tanks as a money-making
enterprise or as a blue collar job. Hence, those needing service will have to procure it from Iligan City,
whose non-Mëranaw employees are reluctant to go to Marawi City, much more to the far flung areas in
Lanao del Sur, because of the bad reputation of the province in terms of security. This then calls for
government interventions (either in the form of direct assistance or through the local incentive-tax
powers to enforce the codes) to address the public bad of poor sanitation and the environmental and
health catastrophes that it could bring.
The IPHO in 2020 initiated deployment of tests to ascertain quality of water sources across the province.
It embarked on subsidizing the procurement of toilet bowls for the marginalized households. The IPHO in
partnership with the LGUs and international and local NGOs provided assistance for the construction of
shared facilities on basic sanitation to achieve zero open defecation, with promising results.

Chapter 7: Culture

L

anao del Sur has long recognized the value of culture and traditions in shaping the local economy.
The rich cultural heritage of the Mëranaws are their cultural capital. They adorned their houses
and public spaces with cultural artefacts. Some of the cultural goods find their way as exports
which are valued by the Philippine art world. They are often showcased in cultural events and state visits
and as masterpieces in famous hotels in highly urbanized cities in the country, which make Mëranaw art
as emblematic of elegance and of cultural diplomacy.
Apart from the tangible culture, the Mëranaws not only celebrate their music, dance, and food culture
during kalilang (or festivities), but the former also embrace them fully in their daily affairs. In addition,
they respect some of the indigenous practices, mores, adät (or customs), and belief system which have
defined the extent of participation of the locals in the development process.
Culture also serves as their social capital. The call of the Lake Lanao (or kiyaranda a ragät [sea on a bowl]
in the language of the Darangën), the melodious bäyok, the Pat a Pängampong sa Ranaw, the sight of the
okir, and many more truly unify the Mëranaws as proud people.
Meanwhile, some areas in Lanao del Sur witnessed a dramatic change in their social demography not long
ago, that impinged on the ancestral territories of the Mëranaws. Time has moved on and so must the
latent discord be set side if the province is to move forward. It needs to capitalize on its cultural diversity
so that all residents in the province can forge their shared future of prosperity.

7.1. Pat a Pängampong sa Ranaw
The Darangën is the pinnacle of cultural expression of the Mëranaws. Recited orally even up to this day,
it is an epic of unparalleled proportion—arguably longer than the Homeric poems of Iliad and Odyssey.
The Darangën describes the birth of the Mëranaw civilization and the emergence of governance system
(the Pängampong sa Ranaw), its social and spatial structures and class, the arts, traditional customs,
etiquette to be a bilangataw (educated and well-mannered), and the world of folklore.
The kasälsila (or the practice of tracing the genealogy) of families and clans, especially among those who
aspire to be community leaders either as a sulutan (sultan) or bae-a-labi57 (female equivalent of sulutan)
or who navigate the settlement of rido (or clan feud), always points to the compass of the characters of
the Darangën and the founders of the Pat a Pängampong sa Ranaw (the four principalities of Ranaw).

57

Also called sulutan a babay.
Vision 2040

Lanao del Sur PDPFP

377

The Pat a Pängampong sa Ranaw is the source of traditional authority, a socio-political system, and, at
the same time, administrative clusters of feudal kinship and social structures. It covers the present day
Lanao del Sur and Lanao del Norte: Bayabao, Balo-i, Masiu, and Unayan. [Refer to Map 66]
The four principalities consists of royal houses—broadly classified as the pägäwidan and the pägäwid.
The royal houses encompass geographic jurisdictions as well as social strata. A detailed discussion of the
traditional governance system is presented in the next chapter.
As a socio-spatial administrative arrangement, each pängampong (principality) is composed of suku
(district), ingëd (township), and agäma (community). The agäma is the smallest unit of settlement in the
Mëranaw society. In the olden days, membership in an agäma put premium on kinship and common
residence. This is perhaps the reason why, even in modern times, the preferred choice of residence,
particularly in urban or peri-urban areas, by a Mëranaw household is significantly influenced by where the
clans or their lolot or tonganay (relatives) or magingëd live. Magingëd are those whose parents or
ancestors come from the same ingëd. Such practice taps the old social ties engendered by the traditional
institution of agäma. This means that even in a relatively homogenous society like the Mëranaw society,
residential segregation by clans characterize many urban settlement patterns.
The sulutan and bae-a-labi wielded significant amount of power in the past. However such authority along
with the traditional socio-political settlement patterns soon dissipated when a Western-type of
governance and geo-political administration (province, municipality/city, and barangay) were introduced.
Today, the sulutan and the bai-a-labi have symbolic authority in Mëranaw communities. They play a vital
role in conflict mediation, and the preserving peace and order.

7.2. Ethnic Mix
Lanao del Sur is dominated by its indigenous inhabitants—the Mëranaws. But, there are some towns
particularly along the borders like Wao which were settled by people from Luzon and Visayas during the
tumultuous part of the Ranaw history in the 20th century.
The state-sponsored resettlement initiatives in Mindanao began in early 1900s through the creation of
agricultural colonies. In the 1920s, the Commonwealth government created the Interisland Migration
Division of the Bureau of Labor and passed the Quirino-Recto Colonization Act in 1935. However, the influx
of settlers into the ancestral territory of the Mëranaws called Ranaw (or the undivided Lanao province)
started in the 1950s when Quirino and Magsaysay administrations allowed captured members of the
Hukbalahap insurgency in central Luzon to move to Ranaw through homestead programs.

The Economic Development Corporation, which is a civic-military outfit to neutralize communist
insurgency in Luzon, established a resettlement town in Kapatagan and later Sapad (now part of Lanao
del Norte) under the banner of “land for the landless” program.58 Wao, which was then part of Maguing,
also evolved as a resettlement area in the 1950s.
The population of non-Moro Filipinos in Ranaw grew more than 30 times from 1918 to 1960, particularly
during the Commonwealth period. The population of Moros (Mëranaws and a few Iranuns in the coastal
areas bordering Maguindanao) grew only five times, although Mëranaws constituted a significant
majority. [Refer to Table 146] To distinguish the ethnic and religious cleavage prompted the Congress
(through Representative Laurentino Lluch Badelles), in 1959, to successfully pass a law59 dividing Ranaw
into two provinces: Lanao del Norte and Lanao del Sur.60

The resettlement programs naturally created tensions among the Mëranaws and the settlers—many of
them ending in violent confrontations resulting in untold number of casualties. Ethnic violence reached
its heights during the martial law under the Marcos administration.
After the martial law, the situation in resettlement towns stabilized, and the communities have remained
peaceful. Residents from various ethnic groups co-existed. However, while certain towns in Lanao del Sur
are ethnically diverse, the remnants of the bitter past are still etched in their communities through the
emergence of residential segregations.

Some of the barangays in Wao, for instance, are named after ethnic groups or places from Luzon and
Visayas to signify the geographic or ethnic affiliations of the residents. This means that these
municipalities underachieve their potential to have an ethnically diverse neighborhoods. Residential
segregation has adverse long-term impact on building community trust and on the evolution of an open
society.
The diversity-segregation index shows the relationship between municipality/city-wide diversity and
barangay-level diversity, based on the Herfindahl score. To show their relative position, the diversitysegregation index of towns and cities of Lanao del are plotted against those in neighboring provinces and
highly urbanized cities (Bukidnon, Lanao del Norte, Maguindanao, and Misamis Oriental as well as
Cotabato City, Iligan City, and Cagayan de Oro City). [Refer to Figure 59]
Figure 59. Ethnic Diversity in Lanao del Sur and Its Neighboring Provinces in 2010

Note: Points on the 90-degree dotted line indicates that neighborhood diversity equals municipal or city-level diversity scores.
Source: Lanao del Sur LGU using raw data on population by ethnicity of PSA-CPH (2010).

As expected, most of the municipalities in Lanao del Sur are ethnically uniform which means that neither
of them is residentially integrated or segregated. They score low in the diversity-segregation index.
Incidentally, a large number of towns in other neighboring provinces are clustered in this category.

Wao, Bumbaran (Amai Manabilang), and Balabagan are highly diverse at the municipal level, yet highly
segregated at the neighborhood level. Malabang and Tagoloan II like Iligan City in Lanao del Norte are
reasonably diverse at the municipal level, but they have a long way to go in reducing neighborhood or
residential segregation. The same is true in the capital, Marawi City, where the preferred choice of
residence of the non-Mëranaws are where other non-Mëranaws live, which happen to be in few areas in
Mindanao State University campus.
None of the municipalities in Lanao del Sur have achieved high diversity and little residential segregation,
such as in Baungon and Impasug-ong in Bukidnon as well as in Upi in Maguindanao.
The latest census indicates that Hiligaynon or Ilonggo, Cebuano, Iranun, Maguindanaon, Ilocano, Binisaya,
Tagalog, Higaonon, and other ethnic groups are the minority in Lanao del Sur. [Refer to Figure 60]

7.3. Challenges in Safeguarding and Promoting the Mëranaw Cultural Heritage
7.3.1. Tangible Heritage
The Mëranaws are known for their ornate woodcraft and brassware to create all sorts of household tools
(e.g. talam), decorative masterpieces (e.g. gädur and bäur), musical instruments (e.g. kulintang and
dëbäkan), traditional weapons (e.g. kris and lantaka), architecture (e.g. torogän), and modes of transport
(e.g. lantsa and awang). Their fine weave and textiles such as traditional tubular clothes (e.g. ina-ul),
tapestries and decorative drapes (e.g. mamandiang), and mats (e.g. dëmpas or riyara) are prized items.
All these pieces of art extensively use okir as a unifying design and folk motif that are distinctly Mëranaw
and yet familiar pieces shared with other Moro ethnic groups and with neighbors in southeast Asia.
7.3.1.1. Non-existent Formal Anthropological Inventory of Cultural Sites
The municipality of Tugaya is widely recognized for the craftmanship of its artisans and cultural workers.
Its inclusion in the list of nominated heritage sites of the UNESCO is an important step in the protection
and preservation of the cultural heritage of the Mëranaws. Apart from Tugaya, there are other areas in
Lanao del Sur that acquired their distinct identity for the production of cultural goods and services
including the indigenous culinary traditions. However, no such inventory employing formal techniques in
anthropology exists which otherwise could have been useful to preserve, safeguard, and promote the
cultural sites and communities. Their potential to become specific cultural industries is high, but they must
be balanced by their sacredness and community acceptance. In addition, there is no effort in general
populace including the LGUs to identify actual places in the province that are mentioned in the Darangën
apart from Bumbaran (Amai Manabilang) as the birthplace of the Mëranaw civilization.
7.3.1.2. Pressures of Westernization and Arabization
The tidal force of Westernization and Arabization have supplanted many aspects of the tangible and visual
arts as well as the indigenous practices including those that combine old Mëranaw practices of Islam with
a tinge of Hinduism, Buddhism, and folk culture. Islam has a tradition of tolerance which was practiced in
Lanao del Sur for centuries. However, stricter interpretations of Islam has become vogue with the arrival
of Middle-eastern and African-educated Mëranaw scholars in the 1990s and pervaded ever since.
The most ubiquitous of this trend are clothing and the mosques. Locals have embraced Western and
Middle-eastern fashion either because of comfort, affordability, evolving preferences, or sheer social
identification. The local ina-ul is worn only during festive occasions. Many still wear malong (tubular
clothing) at home, but the textile used is either of Batik design from Indonesia or Pokok-Batik from
Thailand. The local industry of traditional textile has failed to develop fully because of the shift in the
patterns of trade veering towards the cheaper options.

The architectural design of mosque which traditionally used to be a langgal (a vintage pagoda-like wooden
place of worship) was replaced by Arabic domed-structures with minarets made of concrete. The
Mëranaw have taken it to the extreme so that they constructed dome-shaped mosques at every corner
of towns and city rather than applying standards based on catchment as practiced in the Islamic world.
Many houses being constructed recently even included Mediterranean and other Western motif with few
indigenous adornment.
7.3.1.3. Pressures of Urbanization
Rapid and unmanaged urbanization, particularly in Marawi City and other peri-urban areas, puts at risk
cultural heritage sites. Old houses, buildings, and parks with significant cultural and historical value are
torn down and replaced by structures of dubious designs. There is a pervading sentiment among the locals
that any structure made of concrete is preferable to wood even though old buildings have high historical
or sentimental value.
Air pollution coming from increased volume of vehicular traffic contributes to the rapid corrosion of old
buildings and artefacts including the torogans, old mosques, and brass wares.
Before the Marawi siege, the Rizal Park located in the center of Dansalan was reduced to a tiny patch
because of unabated patterns of encroachment and of poor maintenance by the LGU and the community.
It was a heritage park built during the commonwealth period. Before the 1990s when urbanization went
on full speed in the capital, the park was a venue of cultural events and community building activities. Its
use as a community space soon lost its appeal not only because of poor maintenance and encroachment,
but also because some religious leaders associated the park as a dating venue of unmarried young couples,
which is considered haram (or forbidden).
This only shows that some LGUs put less value on public parks. Not long ago, the Taraka LGU decided to
build a fire station within the premises of the town’s heritage recreational public space, also name Rizal
Park.
Restoration and maintenance of cultural and historical sites is least among the priorities of the LGUs and
of the clans who hold the pusaka because the cost involved in any restoration or refurbishing efforts is
prohibitively high.
7.3.1.4. Unimpeded Commercialization
The rise in domestic trade has led to commercialization of cultural goods. While production on a
commercial scale is not bad in itself, the rapacity of traders to go for volume at the expense of quality of
products will have an adverse reputational effect on value of cultural goods being produced in Lanao del
Sur. For instance, a new generation of artists and tailors who are recipients of various livelihood programs
have employed sewing machines for the production of various articles of clothing or fashion accessories

384

that incorporate the okir design of substandard quality—some are worrisomely unidentifiable as
Mëranaw design.
7.3.1.5. Lack of Associations or Guilds and Standards
And, perhaps, the absence of associations or guilds of artists, artisans, or cultural workers from the wide
spectrum of tangible heritage (wood carving, boat making, brass making, indigenous culinary art, weaving,
etc.) contribute to the proliferation of substandard quality of cultural goods.
Further, no entity exists in Lanao del Sur that authenticates or certifies the quality and even the materials
used for the production of cultural goods. In other countries, the use of Geographic Indication or similar
standards to gauge the authenticity and quality of the materials is vital for the preservation of indigenous
goods including the methods and practices involved in producing them.
7.3.1.6. Nonexistent Culture and S&T Policy Collaboration
There is little support given to artists and artisans who employ traditional methods in producing their
crafts. Modern technology should be welcomed to make the industry competitive, but it is yet to be seen
in Lanao del Sur. In other countries, artisans and cultural workers employ modern technologies that still
preserve elements of the traditional methods.
The lack of collaboration between cultural industry and science and technology (S&T) makes it even more
difficult to introduce innovations in processes while retaining the important elements of indigenous art.
7.3.1.7. Risk Exposure of Imported Raw Materials to Price Movements
Artists and artisans in Lanao del Sur have limited understanding of the supply chain of the cultural good
industry. In Tugaya, for instance, many local artists who make ornate pieces of furniture import shells
used for nacre (or mother-of-pearl) inlay only from Cebu. However, several provinces as Roxas or
Zamboanga del Sibugay produce the same species of bivalves at a much cheaper rate than what they can
get from Cebu City.
Procuring raw materials from a single source exposes the traditional woodcraft industry in Lanao del Sur
to the vagaries of price movements largely dictated by middlemen who behave in oligopolistic manner.
7.3.1.8. Unsustainable Craft
Like all other cultures, the Mëranaw culture evolved from how their ancestors made sense of their
relationship with the natural environment. This means that the survival of the culture crucially depends
on the state of the environment including the watersheds in Lanao del Sur.

Woodcraft artists and artisans have an unsustainable practice of cutting down trees in Lanao del Sur. It is
not clear whether artists or artisans are aware of the log ban nor is there a rule prescribing them to plant
a certain number of indigenous saplings for every tree they harvest. The call for sustainable and
environmentally-friendly wood carving industry in Lanao del Sur is an utmost priority given that the
province is one of the very few in Mindanao with remaining old growth forests.
7.3.1.9. Climate Change and the Impacts of Big Public Infrastructure Programs
The effects of a changed climate system are creeping in Lanao del Sur. Some areas like Balindong (Watu)
and Tugaya have seen the drying up of some portions of the lakeshore. This has affected cultural
communities and sites such as mosques built along the lake from where the faithful perform their
ablution.
In Marawi City, the decision to control the water flow of the Agus Fiver with the completion of the
hydropower electric plants has affected downstream communities particularly in barangays Banggolo,
South Madaya, Bubong Lilod Madaya, Daguduban, Tolali, Saduc, and Mapandi. Prior to 1992, residents
congregated to both sides of the riverbanks to do their washing, bathing, fishing, and all sorts of water
activities regularly. The daily interaction of generations of residents allowed them to develop a particular
sense of community belonginess at both sides of the river. And out of that community interaction, locals
subscribed to their indigenous belief systems, often hushing to appease the tonong (water spirits)
emerging out of huge boulders and tall marang trees lined along the riverbanks. This occurred while they
regularly attended the Friday Islamic prayer in the old mosques also beside the river. It was a picturesque
view of tolerance to indigenous beliefs side by side the Islamic traditions. But this all came to an end with
a new generation of religious scholars and preachers who imposed stricter interpretation of Islam.
Today, not much have remained of the community venue along Agus River in Marawi City. The Task Force
Bangon Marawi began pouring thick concrete replacing the natural embankments of the river to give way
to the proposed cafes and similar modern amenities as part of the reconstruction efforts in ground zero
after the combined forces of militant groups and the security force ravaged the city in 2017.
The Agus River is the only outlet of the Lake Lanao-Agus Watershed. Hence, the installation of the
hydroelectric plants affected the upstream communities in other towns with frequent flooding and
siltation. In Taraka which is a town in the Basak Cluster, some of the cultural and historical sites are not
spared from frequent flooding: 1) the Samporna House, a torogan, where the three ancient Chinese vase
are stored attests to the historical and strategic trading position of the Taraka in the old Ranaw; 2) the
White Rock which holds a particular cultural significance for the enthronement of Sulutan sa Masiu; and
3) Baab-Ur-Rahman Mosque, which is the first mosque in Ranaw.

386

7.3.2. Intangible Heritage
The intangible heritage as living expressions of the Mëranaws covers the folk arts such as dances, music,
medicine, sports, the indigenous belief systems, customary practices, and social etiquettes. However,
several factors contribute to the fading of some of the intangible heritage.
7.3.2.1. Haram and the Folklore
The tonong (water spirits), pantak (sorcerer), dagamot (poison caster or snake charmer), makawgis (a
flying giant that abducts children), nonok (old trees where spirits dwell), omakan (giants that dwell in the
lake), balbal (a beast that feasts on corpse), and other fantastical characters of the old used to occupy a
special place in the collective imagination of the Mëranaws. They appeared in the Darangën. However,
the religious consider them haram (forbidden) or shirk (major sin) so that any mention of these creatures
in public discourse receives a certain amount of disdain.
The Mëranaws have rich fabular traditions other than Darangën. The Arimawnga (the lion), mga tutul sa
Agama Niyog (stories from Land of Coconuts), and the adventures of Pilandok are just few of the many
folktales shared orally by the old generation to the avid listeners of the young. Pilandok is probably the
famous of them having appeared in classic children’s books circulated across the country. The popular
appeal to both children and adults alike has earned these folktales and fables innocuous to the Islamic
traditions.
7.3.2.2. Inaccessibility of the Darangën
The Darangën is a magnum opus of the Mëranaws as it contains a wealth of knowledge about a mythical
kingdom and ways of life of the characters from which the present-day culture and socio-political
structures have emerged. The Darangën are sang in melodious bäyok (or chants) performed by respected
onor (female chanters) or by male pabäbäyok (chanter). In 2005, the UNESCO proclaimed the epic as one
of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.
There are surviving copies of chapters or volumes of the Darangën which few clans managed to transcribe
in kirim script. The latter is a pre-Hispanic handwriting loaned from Arabic letters with few local
innovations. The MSU published seven volumes of the Darangën in Mëranaw and English versions in 1986,
but some of the volumes are missing.
Despite this efforts to safeguard the epic heritage, the younger generations have difficulty understanding
the classical language of the Darangën. Even among the old generations today, few of them understand
the Darangën. It is said that the mawngangën (philosophers and the wise) and good public orators can
only and truly master their craft if they know the language of the Darangën by heart.

7.3.2.3. No Unified Orthography
The fading appreciation of the classical language is a reflection of a much deeper problem in the evolving
Mëranaw linguistics. Few scholars in the past attempted to establish the orthography and to compile a
Mëranaw dictionary, but most of the seminal work by known anthropologists and linguists, who were
foreign missionaries, stored in Dansalan College were ravaged by fire during the 2017 siege in Marawi.
The MSU may have few copies, but some were rotting away for lack of proper conservation efforts and
poor facilities. Much recently, some researchers and literary workers have attempted to revive the
academic work in the field and to popularize the Mëranaw language including the conversational version
by embracing the digital media.
While the past and present efforts to preserve the language are commendable by any measure, many of
the written works still do not capture the indigenous way of pronunciation and even context of the
language. The onus of having to come up with a unified orthography still remains. As the world gets closer
due to improvements in communication, the need for a Mëranaw orthography is essential.
7.3.2.4. Limited Venues for Systematic Transfer of Cultural Knowledge
Embracing the indigenous practices in daily affairs is the best approach to ensure the survival of the
intangible cultural heritage. But some cracks in the transfer of cultural knowledge has opened door for
competing foreign identities to overwhelm the indigenous. Mëranaw professionals and students who
have migrated in various parts of the globe, particularly the Middle East, have imbibed the culture of their
host country, and they carried it with them once they return to Lanao del Sur. The social media, although
helpful in providing a platform to promote the Mëranaw culture, is instrumental in changing attitudes,
preferences, and worldviews especially of the younger generations. Without a firm grasp of the heritage,
Mëranaws are caught in a sea of multiple and competing cultural identities.
Gone were the days where it was common for a skilled pabäbäyok to take a small group of apprentice in
an ingëd. The apprentice who aspired to be either an onor or mawngangën were committed in a semiboarding education setup at the private home of the artist for few months or years even. Very few remains
today of apprenticeship, but such informal arrangement are exclusive to training the lolot (relatives) of
the artists and artisans.
There are school-based student clubs promoting the indigenous dances (singkil, kapmalo-malong, and
sagayan), musical instrument performances (ka-kulintang), and traditional sports (kasipa sa manggis).
However, they can do only so much because they receive little or no financial support from their
universities or the communities.
Compared to other countries like Japan, Thailand, and Indonesia where traditions are celebrated with the
modernity, Lanao del Sur has no program or schooling on traditional etiquettes for kambilangataw. There
is no effort to find value and to pass the heritage of the traditional art of herbal therapeutics (kapamolong)
and the traditional chiropractic and remedial therapy (kapangolit). Rather, modern science sees the
388

complete abandon of the indigenous art even for curing minor ailments. There is no formal training, or a
full-year course on Mëranaw culture and the arts in Lanao del Sur by education service providers.
The absence of formal training in the indigenous Mëranaw culture and arts contributes to placing some
of the indigenous practices in the pedestal of theatrical performances rather than an intrinsic part of
everyday affairs.

Chapter 8: Governance

T

he mechanisms by which resources are allocated are determined by the market economy and
significantly influenced by the governance structures and institutions in Lanao del Sur.
Governance is broadly defined as the quality of management and the orientation of development
policies that the leaders and polity wish the province to undertake. Institutions, on the other hand, define
the rules of the game that determine the complex interactions of structures and actors.
The complexity of governance system in Lanao del Sur is borne out by the trichotomy of institutional
arrangements governing the socio-political relationships of the residents. This emanates from: the formal
institutions and authority, the traditional (adät, mores, social customs) including filial, and the Islamic
which have gained a strong foothold in the communities.
Both the governance structures and institutions have facilitative and regulatory roles in creating and
sustaining economic growth and development in Lanao del Sur.
Some elements of good governance and institutions in Lanao del Sur are discussed below.

8.1. Financial Sustainability
Financial sustainability is an important factor in local government to fund and extend quality social and
humanitarian services. Such can be achieved if there is a good balance between internally-generated
income and external funds. In the best case situations, local government units that generate more income
sourced locally fare better in the provision of basic needs to its constituents than those who rely heavily
on the Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA).
The provincial government of Lanao del Sur (henceforth called Lanao del Sur LGU) and its component
municipal and city LGUs greatly depends on IRA for the funding of the delivery of basic services and other
projects, programs and activities. This scenario is prevalent throughout the local government units of
BARMM, which hinders their capacity to provide quality basic services.
For the past nine years, Lanao del Sur saw a steady rise of its revenues. Lanao del Sur’s income rose from
1.270 billion pesos in 2010 to a whopping 2.256 billion pesos in 2018. However, the increase in the
revenues was solely due to the increase of IRA. The latter oscillated between 96 percent and 99 percent
of the its total finances. High IRA dependency in the province is the result of LGU’s poor collection of
locally sourced revenues. [Refer to Table 147]
The actual total amount of locally sourced revenues dissipated from 39.03 million pesos in 2010 to only
3.23 million pesos in 2018. Local revenue collections was worse in 2017 and 2018 due to the siege in

390

Marawi. [Refer to Figure 61] In the past, its major source of local revenues were business taxes. [Refer to

Unlike other municipalities including Marawi City in Lanao del Sur, only the municipalities of Saguiaran
and Wao had IRA dependency rates were below 90 percent before 2018. [Refer to Table 150]
In order for the local government units to minimize dependency on the IRA share, they need to step up
their efforts to increase revenues through efficient and graft-free local collections. LGUs have to
strengthen their ability to establish, operate and manage economically viable economic enterprises. To
achieve financial resource security, local revenue generation should become a priority to reduce IRA
dependency among LGUs.

8.2. Local Governance
The province LGU oversee all 39 municipalities and one city in promoting the general welfare of its people
as mandated by the provisions of the Local Government Code of 1991. Despite the challenges in previous
years, especially during the tumultuous period of the siege in Marawi, the leadership and its constituents
were able to overcome the calamity although much more have to be done in the coming years on

rehabilitation and recovery efforts. The province LGU, through its offices, continues the general
supervision of overall implementation of programs and projects and provide basic services.

8.2.1. Compliance Metrics of Good Governance
Lanao del Sur has 1,159 barangays, 39 municipalities and one component city. Out of 40 municipal/city
LGUs, only 25 complied with the Local Governance Performance Management System (LGPMS) Profiling
of the DILG in 2019. About 10 municipal/city LGUs participated in the assessment for the SGLG in 2018,
and six municipalities (Balabagan, Buadiposo-Buntong, Calanogas, Kapatagan, Piagapo, and Taraka) were
eventually awarded the seal the following year. [Refer to Table 151]

Many LGUs in Lanao del Sur are overburdened complying with far too many requirements of a plethora
of audit measures of the DILG such as SGLG audit, Peace and Order Council Performance Audit, Provincial
Anti-Drug Abuse Council (PADAC) audit and its municipal counterpart—MADAC audit, Child Friendly Local
Government Audit, LGU Scorecards, among others. Despite these challenges, the number of SGLG
awardees in Lanao del Sur have been increasing from zero in 2015 to six in 2019.
Within BARMM, Lanao del Sur was second to Maguindanao in terms of SGLG passers in 2019. [Refer to

Lanao del Sur has tradition of placing the education of its residents at the forefront of local development
policies since the establishment of the Mindanao State University in 1961. Over the years, the province
has earned the reputation of having the greatest number of schools (both public and private, as well as
formal or madrasah at basic and higher education levels) in BARMM. The spatial policy of the former
regional government even identified the province, particularly Marawi City, as an education hub of the
region. The success of translating educational policies to school and student achievements is hinged on
the governance of educational institutions. The latter defines and regulates the relationships of various
actors in the sector including the resources and the mechanisms of allocating them to good use.
Taraka was the only municipality in Lanao del Sur which was awarded the Seal of Good Education
Governance (SGEG) in 2019 while Balindong (Watu) qualified as one of the finalists. It was the first
recognition received by an LGU in Lanao del Sur since the founding of the SGEG in 2017. The latter is a
scorecard on the collaborative work of communities on basic education, and it is used to measure the
functionality of School Governing Councils and the efforts pursued by the LGU in reconstituting the Local
School Boards to improve the learning performance of children and school reforms. Only 20 municipalities
and cities across the country were awarded the SGEG in 2019. In BARMM, beside Lanao del Sur,
Maguindanao and Sulu each had two SGEG recipients.
Meanwhile, the LGUs (province, municipalities and city) have to institute structural and institutional
economic reforms underpinning the future competitiveness of businesses in Lanao del Sur in order to
modernize the economy, ensure full employment, and mitigate the extent of social exclusion.

In 2019, Marawi City ranked last in the Cities and Municipalities Competitiveness Index of the 112 total
LGU entries, based on a set of criteria developed by the National Competitiveness Council with the
assistance of United States Agency for International Development. Marawi City scored poorly on the four
pillars namely: economic dynamism, government efficiency, infrastructure and resiliency.
The top two most competitive highly urbanized cities were Quezon City and the Manila, while the top
three most competitive component cities were Antipolo, Rizal; Calamba, Laguna and Sta. Rosa, Laguna.
Cainta, Rizal and Taytay, Rizal topped the overall competitive 1st and 2nd class municipalities. Most of the
LGU awardees were from the Luzon area. Only Marawi City among the 39 municipal LGUs participated in
the competitiveness index assessment. Marawi City consistently performed at the bottom rank of
competitiveness since the National Competitiveness Council conceived of the assessment since 2016.

8.2.2. People’s Participation in Local Governance
Broad participation of local constituents including the business sector and the civilians is the cornerstone
of Lanao del Sur’s local governance system and structures, because after all governance is the institutional
arrangements that allows various actors to engage and participate in development processes including
public affairs. Participative governance not only has legal foundations, but it is a type of consensusbuilding (kapamagudäsa or kapamagäyon-ayon) that is inherently rooted in Mëranaw social mores and
traditions. The LGUs manage all its operations through sustained and coordinated efforts among all actors
fostered by the principles of accountability, transparency and responsiveness.
The provincial government regularly convenes various special bodies whose members include civil society
organizations (CSO). They latter actively participate in policy discussion and planning process. To
strengthen and sustain private sector’s participation in local governance and economic development, the
provincial government has endeavored to enhance efforts on citizen’s access to information, budget
transparency, and full disclosure bids and procurements.
The province LGU has 29 special bodies, councils, and committees as of 2019. [Refer to Table 152]

Lanao del Sur LGU organized trainings and other capacity building activities to enhance the competencies
and skills of its personnel to respond better to the needs of the public. The newly established Human
Resource Management and Development Office is instrumental in designing various assessment tools and
training activities to beef up the technical capacity of the employees of the province LGU.
To promote the welfare of the employees and help them go through the prevailing economic crisis, the
Lanao del Sur LGU has implemented salary standardization in accordance with appropriate national laws,
as well as “step-increments” on salaries based on years of service in the office.

8.3. Intergovernmental Relations
The national government, through its agencies and offices, maintains healthy relationship and open
communication with the Lanao del Sur LGU. The goal is to ensure compliance of the LGU to the prescribed

powers and functions in the delivery of basic and public services. This is achieved through provision of
financial, technical or other forms of assistance to the provincial government.
The Lanao del Sur LGU headed by the governor ensures that every component city and municipality acts
within its prescribed powers and functions.

8.4. Judicial and Legal Services
Lanao del Sur has a total of 17 trial courts located in various parts of the province. There are six regional
trial courts—three of which are located in Marawi City, two in Malabang and one Wao. [Refer to Table

The Provincial Legal Office of the Lanao del Sur LGU has been providing legal services particularly on
rendering of legal opinions and advice on various resolutions and ordinances and legal queries endorsed
by the Sangguniang Panlalawigan and other government officials or offices in the province.
Aside from the regular courts, the province has eight shari’a courts. The latter provides services that settle
legal conflicts between Muslim Filipinos on case within the spheres of customary and personal laws (PD
No. 1083 in 1997).
Two of the shari’a courts in Lanao del Sur are in Marawi City: the Fourth Shari’a District Court and the
Marawi City-Saguiaran-Kapai-Tagoloan II-Piagapo Shari’a Circuit Court. These shari’a courts provide
effective administration and enforcement of personal laws among Muslims. The courts handle cases or
complaints involving divorce, property or real estate disputes, child support, dowry questions,
determination of degrees of affinity or consanguinity, determination of paternity and filiation and like
cases. It is also noted that all Sharia courts are under the supervision of the Supreme Court. [Refer to Table

8.5. Traditional Governance
Traditional leaders or the royal sultanates of Lanao del Sur are chieftains of their respective communities.
They are the respected leaders, and they still wield significant amount of authority or influence in their
communities. In modern times, they serve as partners of the municipal and provincial LGUs in local
development and peace building. Although they do not have a power similar to that of the mayor or even
to a barangay captain, the people listen to them.
The Mëranaws trace their traditional governance and social structures to the Pat a Pängampong sa Ranaw
(the four confederated principalities of Lanao): Masiu, Bayabao, Unayan, and Balo-i. Lanao del Sur and
some parts of Lanao del Norte comprise the old Ranaw. The size of the four Pängampong are different
from the present-day municipalities.

Vision 2040

Lanao del Sur PDPFP

401

The Lanao Sultanate embodies the collective customary leadership designed to promote peace and social
cohesion among the Mëranaws. The traditional governance structure is highly hierarchical corresponding
to geo-political and socio-cultural clusters. There four principalities of Ranaw consists of 15 “states” of
sultanates, and each is ruled by a panaroganan (also called sulutan or sultan). These 15 states are called
pägäwidan (meaning “states being supported”) overseen by the royal houses of the sulutan. [Refer to
Figure 68]
The 15 pägäwidan are supported by 28 sub-states called pägäwid (meaning “states that support”). Each
sub-state is ruled by governors who were called m’bäbäya ko taritib (houses of peers or policy makers).
Traditionally, these 28 governors are also called sulutan. The sulutan from pägäwidan and pägäwid are
inter-dependent, and each decision is built on consensus, based on customary laws which are embodied
in the taritib and igma. The pägäwidan and pägäwid are the principal sources of kinship authority of the
of the Mëranaws
In terms of functions, the royal houses through the panaroganan assume the authority, powers, control
and supervision of their respective state. The houses of peers’ primary task are to legislate local customs,
traditions, and laws but subject to the joint concurrence of the royal houses, council of elders and the
board of advisers. The table below shows the confederate states of the Lanao Sultanate from 17th century
and followed up to this day.
At present, some members of the Provincial Advisory Council of the Lanao del Sur LGU are leaders in their
communities or from the pägäwidan and pägäwidan sultanates of Lanao del Sur. They help in the peace
and order efforts of the province LGU. They also help in settling clan feuds or rido.
The province LGU, with the help of the council, settled about 38 cases involving rido in 2019. They resolved
32 rido cases the previous year 2018.

Chapter 9: Peace and Security

L

anao del Sur’s history of conflict can be traced to the brutal pacification in the Ranaw province
during the early years of the American rule in the Philippines and the series of land dispossession
that followed lasting for decades until the last quarter of the 20th century.

The increased militarization of the country by the Marcos administration did not spare Lanao del Sur,
particularly in Wao. It transformed land conflict into ethnic violence culminating in the call of the Moros
across Mindanao for independence. The two peace agreements that created the ARMM and the BARMM
have brought relative peace in the province, but some groups were left out in the process.
Meanwhile, Lanao del Sur has witnessed a trend of rapid population increase and a pattern of unmanaged
urbanization. Some urban and peri-urban areas have overloaded population carrying capacities putting
pressures on urban safety. Unmanaged urbanization paved way for stark rural-urban inequalities. The
disparities in wealth and in access to opportunities, resources, and power have alienated some members
of the society and created packets or subculture of violence and crimes like in any other urbanizing areas
across the globe.
Diminished economic and living conditions in certain parts of Lanao del Sur have produced delinquency
which became a fertile ground for recruitment by other armed groups like the ISIS-fashioned Maute Group
and the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF). The latest incursion was in 2017 when the combined
forces of the Maute Group and Abu Sayyaf Group pitted against the security forces, which, as a result,
upturned the urban core of the capital. The last time that Marawi City was attacked happened in 1972, a
month after the declaration of the martial law, when the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) burned
checkpoints of government troops. But nothing is compared to how the city was ravaged almost half a
century later.
The National People’s Army (NPA) has recently tried its luck to penetrate Lanao del Sur, particularly at the
borders, but in futile efforts, according to the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP).
Meanwhile, a certain type of local conflict pervades across the province, and it is rooted in the informal
institution of maratabat (dignity or intense sense of honor and devotion to family or clan). Rido (or clan
feuds) is a blight to the community life.
The province and constituent LGUs as well as the security sector have various initiatives in ramping up
physical security and public safety. However, there is still much to be done to nip in the bud the drivers of
crimes, violence, and conflict—particularly, inequalities in opportunities. The role of the civil society and
the local communities are vital to the success of curbing security threats in Lanao del Sur.

404

The Philippine National Police (PNP) follows the administrative demarcation of LGUs to ensure the proper
dispensation of services related to public safety and public order. The military, on the other hand, divides
Lanao del Sur into two areas of responsibilities: the 103rd Brigade based in Campo Ranao in Marawi City
and the 6th Infantry Division based in Awang in Maguindanao.
The four coastal towns of Balabagan, Malabang, Picong (Sultan Gumander), and Kapatagan are under the
6th Infantry Division, while the rest of Lanao del Sur is under the 103rd Brigade. [Refer to Map 67]

9.1. Peace and Security
Conflict situation in Lanao del Sur is multi-faceted ranging from insurgency, election-related violence,
land-related conflict, rido, and conflict involving the shadow economy61 (emanating from pyramid scam
or other illicit activities).
There are three insurgent groups being monitored by the security forces and the LGU in Lanao del Sur:
the Maute Group, the BIFF, and the NPA.
The ISIS-affiliated Dawlah Islamiya, also called the Maute Group, is seen as the most immediate security
threat to the province after they staged the bloody attacks in few towns in Lanao del Sur including Marawi
City in 2017. The founders of the group were brothers from Butig who were formers members of the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). Their followers still operate in municipalities to the south of Lake Lanao
such as in Butig, Pagayawan (Tatarikan), and Sultan Dumalondong and areas to the north of the lake like
Balindong (Watu), Marantao, and Piagapo.
The BIFF is a breakaway group of the MILF led by Ameril Umbra Kato. The group operates mainly in
Maguindanao province, with few members from Lanao del Sur. Some members of the BIFF joined the
fighting during the Marawi City in 2017. There are few skirmishes involving the BIFF and the military in
the province in the previous years.
The NPA is confined in the borders shared by Bukidnon, Lanao del Norte, Misamis Oriental, and Lanao del
Sur, particularly in the mountainous or forested areas of Kapai, Tagoloan II, Bubong, Maguing, and Lumba
Bayabao. Because the communist group does not have a foothold in the province, the military does not
perceive the NPA an imminent security threat to the province, but the insurgent group is on the watchlist
of the 103rd Brigade. The AFP believes that the sightings of propaganda materials of the NPA left behind
in abandoned campsites indicate that the group is recruiting local residents in Lanao del Sur to join their
ranks. However, many locals resist the movement because of the fundamental differences in the
communist ideology from the teachings of Islam and the local traditions.

Rido or clan feuding is one of the primary and widely known issue in Lanao del Sur. The tarnished
maratabat arising from a plethora of issues ranging from the petty to the serious. The Provincial Advisory
Council indicated that in 2018 the most common drivers of rido were murder, accident, marital dispute,
physical injury, vehicular accident, sexual indiscretion, and land grabbing. Other triggers can come from
slander, debt default, theft, damage to properties, political rivalry, and election-related conflict. Rido is
common among the Moro ethnic groups, but Lanao del Sur has higher incidence and fatalities. The
prevalence of rido led to the proliferation of illicit firearm ownership and trade.
The trend of recruiting individuals to join armed ideological groups (e.g. Maute Group, BIFF, NPA), as in
the past, is currently refashioned as violent extremism. The usual suspect of sources of grievances and
marginalization (political, social, and economic disenfranchisement, limited opportunities, “conflict
traps,” corruption, mistrust, limited avenues of community building, among others) have shaped
radicalization.
In the past, the national government had long relied on the use of force (“hard approach”) as a military
strategy to curtail radicalization and violence. The elevation of the sources of grievances in the public
discourse of drivers of violence extremism has encouraged the security sector and the LGUs to adopt a
different stance employing a “whole of government approach” in dealing with the scourge of violence
extremism. Appropriate development programs such designed for the community (“soft approach”)
combined with the hard approach are seen as optimal strategy of winning the community to resist
violence extremism. The Kalilintad Roadmap of the province LGU is a direction for sustainable peace and
development for communities exposed to the risk of violence extremism.
The lessons of the Marawi siege that resulted in the countless number of deaths on both sides, the
displacement of more than 200,000 civilians, and an economy in shambles suggests that the cost of
conflict is exorbitantly high. After three years of the attack, the residents of the urban core have not
returned nor recuperated. The rehabilitation efforts of the national government move at a glacial pace. It
will probably take years, or decades even, to rebuild the city center of Marawi. Hence, addressing the root
causes of violence extremism early on is more efficient and effective than pursuing curative ones.

9.2. Public Safety and Order
Public safety and order are the foundations of long-term development of Lanao del Sur. Institutions,
businesses, and communities cannot flourish without a sense of personal and property security. However,
like in other parts of the world, crimes are associated with growth of cities and towns. The challenge for
the provincial and constituent LGUs in Lanao del Sur is to ensure residents feel safe and their rights
protected while they enjoy their daily affairs.

9.2.1. Crime Statistics
There is dearth of historical data on crime statistics in Lanao del Sur. The analysis below is patchwork from
two sources: PNP BARMM Office and PNP Provincial Office in Lanao del Sur.
The PNP BARMM Office published only the 2020 crime statistics on its website, and only the last quarter
has disaggregated figures on index and non-index crime. Needless to say, Lanao del Sur has the second
highest volume of combined index and non-index crime incidents in BARMM next to Maguindanao. [Refer

According to the PNP Provincial Office, Lanao del Sur recorded a total of 357 crime incidents from January
to July 2019 compare to just 267 from the same period of the previous year. Most of these incidents were
non-index crimes which refers to violation of special laws and ordinances. Index crimes involves crimes
against persons such as murder and homicide and crimes against property such as theft. About 39 of the
122 index crimes in 2019 involved murder incidents. [Refer to Figure 70]

Trade in illicit substances are a bane to the communities. Its clandestine nature makes it difficult to assess
its impact to the economy, but drug abuse is strongly associated with high incidence of other types of
crimes and the breakdown of families.
About 544 barangays across Lanao del Sur have recorded incidents involving the sale and use of illicit
drugs according to the PNP Provincial Office in 2018. They represent 46.9 percent of the total number of
barangays in the province. Methamphetamine, locally known as shabu, and marijuana are the common
types of illicit drugs being confiscated by the PNP. Those who survived the encounter with the police force
were either jailed or committed to a Recovery Wellness Program. As of 2019, the PNP Province Provincial
Office profiled 248 suppliers and 4,655 users of illicit substances.

9.2.2. Size of Law Enforcement
The PNP is tasked to enforce the laws, prevent and control crimes, maintain peace and order, and ensure
public safety and internal security. Law enforcers also assist residents prepare for disasters—whether
man-made or natural. The communities, through the People’s Law Enforcement Board, are partners of
the police force for more effective dispensation of duties.62

The PNP Provincial Office in Lanao del Sur has one headquarter, one city police station, and 39 municipal
police stations.
The capacity of the LGUs to keep the Lanao del Sur safe depends on the strength (both number and skills)
of police force. A total of 1,364 police force are deployed in Lanao del Sur. They are composed of 68
commissioned officers, 1,140 non-commissioned officers, and 156 non-uniformed personnel. [Refer to

Note: MPS refers to municipal police station; PMFC, Provincial Mobile Force Company
Source: Lanao del Sur-Provincial Police Office (personnel); raw data of PSA-CPH in 2015 and 2010 (to project 2020 population
using geometric method)

The size of the law enforcement force is inadequate by large measure relative to the population of the
province. Based on the 2020 data, a policeman in Lanao del Sur served about 860 residents. The standard
legal requirement is 500 members of the population for every one policeman. If the current capacity of
police force in Lanao del Sur continues, then the police-to-population ratio will go up as high as one
policeman per 1,086 population in 2030 and one policeman per 1,376 population in 2040. [Refer to Table
158]
This means that in 2020, Lanao del Sur had a shortfall of 982 policemen. If the needs in 2020 will continue
to be unmet, the province will need an additional 1,598 policemen in 2030 or 2,390 policemen in 2040 so
that it can adequately tackle public order and safety.
The disparity exists by municipal or city police stations. The top 10 city and municipalities with the highest
ratio of policeman to population in 2020 were: Marawi City, Lumba-Bayabao, Wao, Masiu, Marantao,
Balindong (Watu), Tamparan, Piagapo, Malabang, and Maguing.
The only municipality that met the legal requirement of 1:500 is Lumbaca-Unayan. The municipality had
350 population for every one policeman in 2020. Sultan Dumalondong and Tagoloan II followed, with 505
and 507 population, respectively, for every one policemen.

9.2.3. Safeguarding the Population
9.2.3.1. Surveillance and Monitoring
The optimal provision of public safety of the province is as good as the securing the nodes or parts of the
city that are most vulnerable to risks and danger (“the chokepoints). The need for constant monitoring
and surveillance is vital for public safety, subject to the limits of the law on protecting the human rights.
The PNP Provincial Office in Lanao del Sur maintains five fixed checkpoints and 48 mobile checkpoints.
Each checkpoint conducted an average of 60 operations daily, as of 2020.
Automation of monitoring and surveillance is helpful for speedy and accurate detection of threats while
lowering staff costs. However, the province have very few closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras
installed in strategic area for reliable and sensitive protection of the people and properties. Only
Balindong (Watu) and Marantao have installed CCTV cameras in public spaces. The Lanao del Sur LGU has
also CCTV cameras mounted within the Provincial Capitol Complex.
Installing CCTV cameras in chokepoints as well as in areas, where vital infrastructures (power and
electricity, transportation, water, and telecommunication towers) are situated, is essential to prevent
threats that may disrupt societal life.
9.2.3.2. Fire Protection
The Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP), which is under the MILG, is mandated by law to enforce the fire safety
measures and to save lives and properties as well as to serve the community at all times. It also provides
medical, rescue, emergency and disaster services. Therefore all BFP personnel are deemed to standby
24/7 in the station.
The BFP in Lanao del Sur is composed of 17 fire stations. However, only six of them, including the
provincial office, have fire trucks. [Refer to Table 159] The bureau employs a total of 198 fire personnel
across Lanao del Sur.

9.2.4. Protecting Public Service
The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that the vulnerability of the population to infectious disease due to a
changed climate system can result in untold number of casualties and an economy left in disarray. The
transmission of the disease gains more speed resulting from increased population density and large
movements of people.
The province has taken several measures to stop the spread of the disease. Tracing individuals who
contracted the disease and those who have high risk of exposure to the illness and placing them in a
quarantine or isolation area have proven to be effective.
The province LGU moved for work-at-home arrangement to lower the level of vulnerability of civil servants
while they continue providing essential public service including provision of direct assistance through
mobile markets to communities and households affected by lockdown during the early part of the
outbreak. The Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases in Lanao del
Sur was constituted following a national directive.

9.4. Normalization
To ensure human security in BARMM, the normalization process is embedded in the peace agreement
signed between the Government of the Philippines and the MILF in 2014. The annexes of the
Comprehensive Agreement provides the framework on the decommissioning of MILF fighters and their
weapons, dismantling of mines and unexploded ordinances, the disbanding private armed groups,
redeployment of the AFP in BARMM, as well as confidence-building measures. The latter include the

414

transformation of several camps into progressive and resilient communities. The intention of the
normalization process is to bring peace dividend to the existing flash point areas of conflict.
The MILF has three camps in the province of Lanao del Sur, namely Camp Bushra Somiorang, Camp Bilal,
and Camp Abubakar as-Siddique. [Refer to Map 68]
Under the program, MILF forces will be decommissioned in four phases. This year, around 12,000
combatants, which account for 30 percent of the total 40,000 MILF members, are set to be
decommissioned.
